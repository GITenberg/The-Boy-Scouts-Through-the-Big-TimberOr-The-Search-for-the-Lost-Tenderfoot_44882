<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS
<br />THROUGH THE BIG TIMBER</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE CAMP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Call the roll, Mr. Secretary,&rdquo; said the acting
scoutmaster.</p>
<p>Of course this was a mere matter of form, because
everybody knew that the entire membership
of the Silver Fox Patrol, connected with the Cranford
Troop of Boy Scouts, was present. But
nevertheless Bob White gravely took out his little
book, and made each boy answer to his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad Brewster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present,&rdquo; said the patrol leader, and assistant
scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan Hollister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied the second in command, a Maine
boy, now living in Cranford, the New York town
from whence these boys had journeyed to this far-off
region along the foothills of the great Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus Hawtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto,&rdquo; sang out the fat youth, looking up with
a wide grin; for he was about as good-natured as
he was ponderous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe Stedman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More ditto,&rdquo; answered the tall lad, with the
long neck, and the quick movements, who was busying
himself over the fire, being never so happy as
when he could feed wood to the crackling blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On deck,&rdquo; replied the boy mentioned, who was
busy with the supper arrangements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davy Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.&rdquo; came from the fellow who was walking
on his hands at the moment, his waving feet being
high in the air, where his head was supposed to appear;
because Davy was a gymnast, and worked off
his superfluous energy in doing all manner of queer
stunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smithy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Present,&rdquo; and the speaker, a very natty chap,
brushed off an imaginary insect from the sleeve of
his coat; because it happened that Edmund Maurice
Travers Smith, as he was known in his home circle,
had been born with a horror for dirt: and it was
taking his comrades a long time to bring him down
to the ordinary level of a happy-go-lucky, care-free
boy like themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert White Quail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the last named being the secretary himself,
he merely put a cross down, to indicate the fact of
his being in the line of duty on that occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You neglected two other important members
of the party!&rdquo; called out Giraffe, who, of course
had gained his peculiar name on account of the
habit he had of often stretching that unusually long
neck of his, until the boys likened him to an ostrich,
and then a giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; demanded Bob White, scenting
some sort of joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike, and Molly, the honest, hard-working
mules here that we have for pack animals,&rdquo; replied
the tall scout, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I reckon, suh, they don&rsquo;t count on the
roll call,&rdquo; remarked Bob White, who was a Southern
boy, as his soft manner of speech, as well as
certain phrases he often used, betrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; protested Giraffe, sturdily, &ldquo;if you
think now, that our pack mules ain&rsquo;t going to make
an impression on our camping through the big
timber, and the foothills of the Rockies, you&rsquo;ve
got another guess coming, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mike strikes me as particularly worthy of mention
in the log book of the trip. He made a
<i>distinct</i> impression on me, right in the start; and
left a black and blue record of it that hurts yet,&rdquo;
with which remark, fat Bumpus&mdash;whose real name
chanced to be Jasper Cornelius, began to ruefully
rub a certain portion of his generous anatomy.</p>
<p>A general shout went up at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what could you expect, Bumpus?&rdquo; demanded
Davy Jones. &ldquo;When Mike, out of the
corner of his wicked eye, saw you stooping over
that way, and offering such a wide target, the
temptation was more than any respectable, well-educated
mule could resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Step Hen, who had divided his
name in that queer fashion as a lad first attending
school, and it had clung to him ever since;
&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t know the strong points of pack mules,
Bumpus, or you would never have gone so close
to his heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Davy, humorously, &ldquo;you
turned over in the air three times, before you struck
that dirty pool of water. And that time, Bumpus,
I own up you beat me fairly at gymnastics; for try
as I will, so far I&rsquo;ve only been able to do two turns
backward in the air, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus, being so good-natured, only chuckled
and kept on rubbing, as in imagination he saw the
&ldquo;cartwheels&rdquo; he made in the air on that memorable
occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only thing I deeply regret,&rdquo; continued Davy,
&ldquo;was that I didn&rsquo;t have my camera focussed at the
time. That picture would sure have been the gem
of our collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus presently sat himself down again, to
watch those who were serving as cooks for that
occasion, get supper ready.</p>
<p>And while it is preparing, with the fragrant odor
of coffee in the air, making the hungry boys almost
frantic with suspense, perhaps, for the benefit
of the reader who has not made the acquaintance
of these lively, wide-awake boys in earlier stories
of this series, a brief explanation of who and what
they were, may be deemed appropriate at this
point.</p>
<p>The Silver Fox Patrol had been organized for
quite some time now, and the boys who made up the
membership had been fortunate enough to take two
long trips, with the idea of adding to their knowledge
of woodcraft, and such qualities as all good
scouts are supposed to desire to possess.</p>
<p>The first one had been to the region of the Land
of the sky. Robert Quail had come from the Blue
Ridge, in North Carolina, and it was mostly
through his influence and persuasion that the scouts
had gone thence. And while there, they had met
with many adventures that have been faithfully
chronicled in their log book, and portrayed in a
previous story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Their next trip came in very fortunately. An
epidemic breaking out in Cranford, the school
trustees closed the doors of the places of education
until after the Christmas holidays. This gave the
boys the chance they had long wanted to take a
run up into Maine, and do a little camping, and
hunting of big game; several of their number being
very fond of handling a gun; and Allan having
told them thrilling stories of the sport to be found
in his native State after the law had been lifted.</p>
<p>And while enjoying themselves hugely, the scouts
had had the good fortune to recover some stolen
bonds and other valuables belonging to a bank that
had been robbed. The reward offered for their
restoration was paid over into their treasury, and
was of such a size as to admit of their taking this
long-desired journey into the mountain region of
the Great Northwest, when vacation time came
around.</p>
<p>During the balance of the winter, after their return
from Maine, the story of the wonderfully
good times they enjoyed there had so enthused other
boys of Cranford, that a second full patrol, called
the Eagle, had been organized; and a third addition
to the troop, to be called the Gray Wolf, was
in process of forming.</p>
<p>But of course none of these lads had any share
in the reward that had come to the members of the
first patrol; so that accounted for their not being
present on his occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Bumpus was a musician, and had a fine mellow
voice, which he often used to entertain his mates
while sitting around the roaring camp-fire. He
could play on any instrument; indeed, with merely
his doubled-up hands, and his melodious voice, he
often imitated various calls on the bugle. And of
course he had been elected as bugler to the troop,
though on the present occasion they had induced
him to leave his instrument at home, not thinking
a hunting camp the place for such noisy demonstrations.</p>
<p>The boys carried guns of various sorts, though
until lately Bumpus had never bothered himself
about such a thing. But while in Maine the fever
seized him, and he had purchased a big ten-bore
Marlin double-barreled shotgun; because he always
admired the twelve gauge of the same make which
Thad owned.</p>
<p>Step Hen had a little beauty of a thirty-thirty six-shot
repeating rifle, that had been given to him by
his father on a recent birthday. Thad sometimes
borrowed it, and could use the same with considerable
skill. It carried those soft-nosed bullets that
mushroom when striking, and thus do all the work
of a ball several times the size. If big game must
be killed, the quicker the thing is over with the
better. Besides, that little fire-arm was &ldquo;just as
light as a feather,&rdquo; as Step Hen always declared,
when disputing with Giraffe, who carried the large
rifle owned by his respected dad, also fond of the
woods and game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Davy managed to get along with a shotgun, while
Allan had a rifle. Smithy and Bob White had
brought no weapons along, deeming the number on
hand amply sufficient to clean out most of the wild
beasts inhabiting the Rocky Mountain region. In
fact, Smithy had never shot a gun in his life, and
was timid about trying; but on the other hand Bob
was quite used to working with a good retriever
in the grain fields, where the bird he was named
after fattened, away down in the Old Tarheel
State.</p>
<p>Davy seemed to be unusually full of animal
spirits on this occasion. He just could not keep
quiet, but kept up his tumbling, and standing on
his head, even though no one paid much attention
to what wonderful stunts the athletic lad was carrying
on.</p>
<p>Close by them ran a noisy stream. It came out
from the foothills of the great uplifts near by, and
went brawling on its way. Indeed, it made so
much music that the scouts had to call out to each
other at times; but somehow the prospect of passing
a night near such a rollicking stream pleased
them all. Besides, they were sure it must contain
trout, and several promised to get up at break of
day to try for the speckled beauties, so that they
might have a mess for breakfast, before continuing
on their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, has anybody seen my sweater around?&rdquo;
called out Step Hen, who was busily engaged looking
over the contents of his pack, having turned
over the control of the cooking meal to Allan and
Thad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sure I stowed it away in this
knapsack I carry, but it ain&rsquo;t there now. I&rsquo;m the
unluckiest feller you ever did see, about having my
things taken. Everybody just thinks they&rsquo;re general
property, and grabs &rsquo;em up. Please hand it
over, whoever&rsquo;s got it. I might want it to-night, if
it gets cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen was careless. He had a long-standing
habit of never knowing where he put his things,
and hence, when he missed some object, loud were
his wails about being pursued by a &ldquo;little evil
genius,&rdquo; that was taking the greatest delight in
misplacing his possessions. Even when one of the
other scouts, taking pity on Step Hen, would show
him where he had himself left the article, he would
pass it off as easily as a duck shakes the water
from its back.</p>
<p>The tents had been raised, and everything looked
cozy and comfortable. Several of the scouts lay
around, being footsore and weary; only that never-tired
Davy was still exercising himself in all sorts
of ways. In due time he would work off his superfluous
energy, and behave. They were so accustomed
to seeing Davy hang by his toes from the
high limb of a tree, or doing some similar act better
fitted for the circus than a camp of Boy Scouts, that
little attention was ordinarily paid to his actions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>It came as a shock, then, when all of a sudden
Thad started up with a shout, and started on a run
toward the edge of the high river bank, where one
could look down on the tumbling waters of the
churning yeasty rapids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, boys!&rdquo; the scoutmaster was calling at
the top of his voice, as he covered the dozen yards
separating the camp from the edge of the little
bluff; &ldquo;Davy went too near the edge, and took a
header right over into the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one of the other six lads hurried as fast
as possible to join their leader on the brink of the
bluff; and when they reached there, they saw a
sight that for the moment seemed to freeze the very
blood in their veins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT FRIGHTENED THE PACK MULES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on to the rock, Davy! We&rsquo;ll get you
out!&rdquo; whooped Giraffe, greatly excited, so that
Thad, believing the tall scout meditated jumping
after the boy who was already at the mercy of that
swift current, dropped a restraining hand on his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must a hit his head when he fell; you c&rsquo;n
see he looks dazed!&rdquo; cried Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he did, I reckon!&rdquo; added Bob White,
as he clenched his hands, and stared at the figure
out in the midst of that rushing, boiling water.</p>
<p>Davy looked far from nimble just then. He was
clinging desperately to a slippery moss-covered rock
that just projected above the foamy water. If he
allowed his grip to slacken he would be instantly
carried into a pocket that had all the appearance of
a whirlpool; and once lost in that gap, where the
water whirled around and around, Davy might
never come out alive again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Under ordinary conditions the agile lad might
have had a fair chance to work out his own salvation,
for he was a good swimmer; but just as
Bumpus said, possibly he had struck his head when
falling, and this dazed him. He could only hang
on there, and look appealingly toward his comrades,
high up on the bank.</p>
<p>Thad saw immediately that the task of rescuing
their comrade would prove to be not a little one,
even though Davy could hold on for a few minutes
longer, which was uncertain, since the current was
very strong, and seemed to drag at him with a dozen
eager hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rope! We must have a rope!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bumpus? Take this rope!&rdquo; came
from Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; here, get your coat off, Bumpus, in
a big hurry!&rdquo; exclaimed Thad, whirling upon the
fat boy, who was even then starting to obey.</p>
<p>Strange to say, as soon as he had undone his
loose coat, one of the reasons for his apparent great
size through the body became apparent. Bumpus
had a small but stout clothes-line wound around
his body many times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>While up in Maine he had taken a fancy for
having a rope close to his hand. On many occasions
he had seen the great value of such a thing; and it
had by degrees become almost a mania with Bumpus;
who secured just such a rope as he thought
best adapted for the purpose, and carefully wound
it around his body every morning.</p>
<p>And as the possession of such a thing caused the
scoffing scouts to call it a lariat, of course Bumpus
was privately and publicly doing his level best to
throw the rope, as he had once seen some cowboys
connected with a traveling circus do; but with rather
poor success thus far, for his build rather unfitted
him for doing such strenuous work.</p>
<p>Bumpus was so clumsy about most things that
it could not be expected that on the present occasion,
when there was so much need of haste he
could satisfy the nervous demands of his camp-mates.</p>
<p>He started to unwind the rope, but twice the end
fell from his shaking fingers, when he heard Giraffe
call out that Davy seemed to be about to let go his
hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Unable to stand such dilly-dallying tactics, Allan
and Giraffe presently took hold of the fat boy, and
began to whirl him around as though he were a
teetotum, while Thad pulled at the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, quit that!&rdquo; roared Bumpus, throwing out
his hands in an effort to catch hold of something,
for he was rapidly growing very dizzy under this
treatment; &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye think I am, a top that wants
spinning? Hi! ketch me somebody, I&rsquo;m going to
tumble over!&rdquo; and as the last remnant of the
clothes-line slipped from his rotating form, the fat
scout did reel around like a drunken man, though
quickly recovering from the dizzy sensation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad was busy. Fortunately Bumpus
always kept a nice noose at the end of the rope,
with a running knot. Thad knew this, for he had
many a time thrown the lariat with considerable
skill, when showing the owner just how it should
be done.</p>
<p>Hastily he gathered the coils of rope in his hand,
and rushed again to the edge of the little bluff looking
out on the rapids.</p>
<p>He drew a breath of relief when he saw that the
unfortunate gymnast was still there, clinging desperately
to that slippery rock, and yet apparently
well-nigh exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="#front" id="rfront">Look out for it, Davy, and grab the noose when
it comes near! Here goes!</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the scoutmaster gave the rope several
whirls about his head, and then launched it
forward. The others watched the result, with
hearts that seemed to actually stand still with suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed him!&rdquo; cried Giraffe, in despair, as the
rope struck the surface of the swift water about
five feet or more above the imperiled scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad wanted to send it there; see!&rdquo; exclaimed
Allan.</p>
<p>Just as the one who had thrown the rope expected,
the noose was instantly seized by the foaming
waters, and swept downward, straight at the
clinging boy. Although Davy may have been partly
dazed, he had known enough to hang on with might
and main. And right then and there he seemed to
understand what Thad meant to do; for as the
rope was borne up against the partly submerged
rock to which he clung, the boy made a quick snatch
at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He lost it!&rdquo; shrieked Bumpus, who had recovered
enough now to crawl near the edge in
order to see what was going on; though not daring
to trust his weight too near the brink, lest the earth
crumble under him, and let him drop into the rapids
where Davy was already fighting for his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much he did!&rdquo; echoed Giraffe; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got
it all right! Good boy, Davy! Slip it under your
arms, and we&rsquo;ll yank you out in a jiffy! That&rsquo;s the
ticket! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy seemed to understand what he must do.
It was not enough that he gripped the noose at the
end of the saving rope; for once in the power of the
tossing current of the whirlpool he might lose his
hold.</p>
<p>And so he managed to put his arm right through,
after which he held on with might and main with
that hand while he got the second one through the
loop.</p>
<p>It was the last straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back;
Davy was so completely exhausted by this effort
that he just had to let go, and trust to his comrades
to do the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Thad began to pull with all his strength, and
others laid hold on the line, to add their mite to
the work of rescue. Fortunately Bumpus had
selected a splendid braided window-sash cord when
he picked out his rope, capable of standing an
enormous strain; and it held, despite the drag of
the savage whirlpool, and the rush of the rapids.</p>
<p>Through the white foaming waters Davy was
dragged in great style. One of them managed to
get down the little bluff, and helped the almost
drowned scout to clamber up. But hardly had Davy
reached the camp than he fell in a faint, utterly exhausted.
Excitement had more or less to do with
it, perhaps fright as well; for he had really been
facing death during those few minutes when he
held on with such splendid grit.</p>
<p>Thad soon brought him to; and upon examining
the boy&rsquo;s head he did discover a pretty good-sized
lump, showing that what they suspected must have
taken place; and that Davy had struck against a
rock in falling.</p>
<p>Davy was unusually quiet for the rest of the
afternoon, and pretty serious for one of his animal
spirits. He realized that he had had a close call;
and never more would he make fun of poor Bumpus
for such a silly fad as carrying a rope around with
him wherever he went. Only for that Davy might
have had a much more serious time of it, even if he
were rescued at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>They were having an early supper for many
reasons. The tramp had been rather tiresome on
this day; and besides, that location on the side of
the noisy mountain stream had taken their fancy.</p>
<p>When the meal was ready Bumpus made a bugle
of his hands, and blew the &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; in fairly
good style. But none of the hungry scouts waited
for him to get through; for they were hard at it as
soon as he started. Indeed, Bumpus himself cut his
&ldquo;call&rdquo; short, as he saw the tremendous inroads
being made on the visible supply of food; and
hastened to take his place, fearful lest he be left
mourning, with a scant ration.</p>
<p>Had Davy been half drowned by his submersion
in the water, the scoutmaster knew just what to do
in order to restore him. He would have placed the
boy on his stomach, with his arms elevated; and
while two of the others worked these back and forth
like pump handles, Thad would have knelt astride
Davy, pressing regularly downward with his hands
or knees; the idea being to produce an artificial
respiration, and encourage the heart to take up its
suspended functions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>It still lacked half an hour of sunset when they
finished supper; and Bob White was even thinking
of getting out some fishing tackle, in order to see
if he could coax a few trout from the stream, at the
foot of the rapids below.</p>
<p>The two mules, Mike and Molly, had been staked
out at the end of their ropes, and were cropping the
green grass that grew abundantly near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t things look just fine and dandy around
here, though?&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, as they lay
there, feeling too full of supper to do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and so far we haven&rsquo;t missed those two
guides who gave us the cold shake,&rdquo; Giraffe added.
&ldquo;One of &rsquo;em had to go and get sick; and the other
broke his contract, and went off with those two
Eastern sportsmen who came out here to shoot
mountain sheep, just like they do chamois over in
Switzerland. But we&rsquo;re going to get on all right
without &rsquo;em; though I hope we manage to run
across that Toby Smathers they told us about, and
who&rsquo;s up here somewhere on his own hook doin&rsquo;
something, nobody seemed to know just what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;they told us he was
just the right kind of a guide to get. He&rsquo;s been
through the whole mill&mdash;lumber-jack, trapper,
hunter, timber cruiser; and forest ranger employed
to look out for fires, and watch some of those
thieves of timber pirates sent in here by the big
lumber concerns to steal millions of millions of feet
of valuable lumber every winter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! now Mike&rsquo;s gone and caught it!&rdquo; cried
Giraffe.</p>
<p>This caused all of them to sit up, and take notice
that one of the mules was dancing at a lively clip
at the end of his rope. He would stand up on his
hind legs, and strain at his stake; then turning, he
would kick as far as he could; and carry on in a
most remarkable manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the dickens ails the beast?&rdquo; asked Step
Hen. &ldquo;Has a bumble bee stung him on the nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, it&rsquo;s catching,&rdquo; retorted
Giraffe, grinning. &ldquo;He saw the way Davy here
was walking around on his hands, with his feet in
the air; and Mike wants us to see if he can do better
than that. I reckon he&rsquo;ll stand on one foot after a
bit, and show Davy stunts he dassent try to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there goes Molly trying the same dodge,&rdquo;
shouted Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, if that don&rsquo;t beat the Dutch!&rdquo;
ejaculated Giraffe. &ldquo;As sure as I live, fellers, they
mean to make it a double harness affair, a team of
educated mule gymnasts. Go it, Mike! Hey, show
us what you can do, Molly! I&rsquo;m believing she c&rsquo;n
beat her pardner all hollow. Look at that jump,
would you? Say, they must a been eating some of
that loco weed we heard about, fellers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re frightened, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; exclaimed
Thad, as he started to cast his eyes around in search
of any unusual object, but failing to discover such;
from which fact he judged that the mules depended
on their sense of smell to tell them there was danger
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightened; what at?&rdquo; echoed Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but if ever I saw a scared mule,
that Mike is one,&rdquo; Thad went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him jerk, would you?&rdquo; cried Giraffe.
&ldquo;Unless that stake gives way soon, he&rsquo;ll sure break
his old stubborn neck. Whoa! there, you silly;
nothing&rsquo;s going to hurt you. Wow! there he goes
awhoopin&rsquo;, Thad! The stake did give way, before
he dislocated his spine. And there&rsquo;s Molly bound
to follow after him, whoop! see her tear, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s broke away too, and is trailing the rope
after her!&rdquo; cried Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now, won&rsquo;t we just have a dandy old time
hunting our pack mules again; unless by some
accident that stake and rope get caught in the rocks,
and holds &rsquo;em up; which I&rsquo;m hoping will be the
case,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, looking blankly after the
two disappearing animals, that, when last seen,
were still acting in the most remarkable manner,
and giving every evidence of a severe fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what d&rsquo;ye suppose, scared the fools that
way?&rdquo; demanded Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps they just felt frisky, and wanted to
show us their heels. I told you they&rsquo;d be mad, if
you didn&rsquo;t include them on the roll call,&rdquo; Giraffe
remarked; though in truth, he was feeling anything
but funny just then, as he contemplated the possibility
of their being stranded away out there
under the shadow of the great Rockies, without
a single pack animal to &ldquo;tote&rdquo; their camp luggage
either way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look around, and see if you can spy anything
moving,&rdquo; advised the scoutmaster, making use of
his own sharp eyes at the same moment.</p>
<p>Immediately Bumpus called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that lumbering along over yonder,
Thad? Looks to me like an old, cinnamon-colored
cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad took one look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re away off there, Bumpus,&rdquo; he remarked,
in a thrilling tone; &ldquo;because those two wise mules
knew what was coming. That is anything but a
cow or even a bull. It&rsquo;s a bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear!&rdquo; almost shrieked Bumpus, making a
dive for the nearest tent, in which lay his nice ten-bore
Marlin, loaded with buckshot shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thad went on, &ldquo;and a great big grizzly
bear at that. Let&rsquo;s hope he&rsquo;ll give us the go-by,
and walk on about his own business!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN THE FOXES TOOK TO THE TREES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, Bumpus, you&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; shouted
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; went the other barrel of the new ten-bore
gun, with which the fat scout was determined
he would sooner or later get a bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he knocked him over!&rdquo; shrieked Step Hen,
who had managed in some mysterious way to
get possession of his own gun, and was visibly disappointed
because it began to look as though he
could not make use of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus has killed a grizzly!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe;
and then, quick on the heels of this exultant cry he
added: &ldquo;no he ain&rsquo;t, either! Look at him gettin&rsquo;
up on all fours again! Now he&rsquo;s sighted us, fellers!
Here he comes, licketty-split! A tree for
mine! They told us grizzlies couldn&rsquo;t climb trees,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Giraffe was as good as his word. He seemed to
fairly fly over to the nearest tree, and the way those
supple long legs wrapped around the slender trunk
was a sight worth seeing.</p>
<p>A panic broke out among the rest, especially when
Thad shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up a tree, everybody! Quick, now, he&rsquo;s
coming right along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Step Hen had his rifle, and knew that it
could be depended on to do its work, provided the
marksman himself was there with the good aim.
Step Hen did not have full confidence in his ability
to plant a bullet where it would do the most execution.
Besides, the sight of that savage monster
lumbering along, and looking so very fierce, gave
poor Step Hen an attack of the &ldquo;rattles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard the scoutmaster call out for every
one to hunt a tree, Step Hen felt that he must be
included in that order. If all the others climbed
to safety, it would be the height of folly for him to
remain below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>And not wanting to play the part of Casibianca,
the boy who &ldquo;stood on the burning deck, whence
all but him had fled,&rdquo; Step Hen, dropping his gun
as he ran, made for a tree that seemed to offer all
the advantages of home.</p>
<p>Just ahead of him was Bumpus, gripping a limb
with a desperation born of despair, and struggling
furiously to get one of his fat legs entwined above,
when he might hope to pull himself up.</p>
<p>Step Hen had no trouble in mounting on his side
of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Bumpus a hand, Step Hen!&rdquo; shouted the
scoutmaster, already settled in a nest of his choosing.</p>
<p>As one scout is expected to help another whenever
the chance arises, doubtless Step Hen would
have rendered this &ldquo;first aid to the clumsy&rdquo; even
though Thad had not seen fit to call out.</p>
<p>There was really need of haste. The wounded
bear was perilously near, and seemed to be heading
straight for the tree where Bumpus was, unable, in
his excitement and fright to draw his body up on
the limb to which he clung.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>His fat face was white, and his eyes seemed almost
ready to pop out of his head, as Step Hen,
bending down, caught hold of his coat collar. It
looked as though the angry bear just knew which
of these campers had inflicted this pain upon him,
and was bent upon revenge.</p>
<p>But Step Hen was strong, moreover, the necessity
of moving the unwieldy body of Bumpus was
great. Exerting himself as the fat scout commenced
to strain again, Step Hen managed to get Bumpus
up alongside him.</p>
<p>Even then there was more or less danger that the
grizzly might stand erect on his hind legs, and be
able to claw them, so the boys hastened to put more
distance between their precious bodies and the
furious beast.</p>
<p>When the bear found that he could not reach
any of the scouts, he spent some little time rolling
from one tree to another, and looking up at the
boys in the branches and sending forth loud growls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scat! get out!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe. &ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;s
a goin&rsquo; to try and climb up my thin tree. Here, quit
that, you old scamp! Look what he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;, Thad!
Wow! he wants to shake me down like a big
persimmon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>The bear did actually shake the slender tree to
and fro, by exerting his tremendous strength.
Giraffe had a few anxious minutes. He had to hold
on with all his might to keep from being dislodged.
And then again, there was always a chance that the
furious grizzly might actually snap the tree off.</p>
<p>After a short time the animal seemed to tire of
this sport. Greatly to the relief of Giraffe he
ambled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old feller! Come again when you
can&rsquo;t stay so long!&rdquo; cried Giraffe, whose courage
returned when he realized that his safety was
assured.</p>
<p>But the bear did not have the remotest idea of
abandoning his game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He smells our grub, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; called out
Bumpus. &ldquo;See him sniffing, would you? And
there he goes, right at our stock of things. Oh!
what if he gobbles it all up, whatever will we do,
stranded away up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something, boys, to chase him
off,&rdquo; declared Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had some powder up here, I&rsquo;d show him,&rdquo;
declared Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; demanded Smithy, who
for once had not waited to pick out a clean tree,
when he started to &ldquo;elevate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d wet some powder, and make those
sputtering &lsquo;devils&rsquo; you remember I used to carry
around with me. Then I&rsquo;d get the old bear right
under, put a match to a bunch of the powder, and
when it took to sending out sparks to beat the band,
I&rsquo;d drop it on his back. Wow! but take my word
for it, boys, he&rsquo;d make tracks out of this in a cloud
of smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suh, why don&rsquo;t you do that, and help us
out of a bad scrape?&rdquo; demanded Bob White, whose
hot Southern blood fairly boiled at the ridiculous
idea of eight wide-awake scouts being made
prisoners, by just one old bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several reasons,&rdquo; replied Giraffe, calmly.
&ldquo;In the first place I don&rsquo;t happen to possess a single
match, even if I had the powder, which is not the
case. And then again, I want to see how our
sagacious and resourceful scoutmaster works his
little game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This caused all the others to turn their attention
toward Thad. For the first time they discovered
that he was lowering a long piece of cord, with an
open loop a few inches in diameter at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know what he&rsquo;s hoping to do,&rdquo; sang out
Bumpus. &ldquo;He wants to fish up Step Hen&rsquo;s gun,
that lies just below him, where Step Hen dropped
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; declared Davy Jones, excitedly,
as he watched the operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at the bear, fellers!&rdquo; cried Giraffe.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right at it now, chawin&rsquo; up our grub as if
he could store away the lot of it. Guess he&rsquo;s forgot
all about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; declared Allan. &ldquo;Watch
me prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he made as if to descend his tree.
No sooner had his swinging legs attracted the
attention of the bear, than uttering savage growls
he abandoned his feast, and came hurriedly over,
to look up at Allan with those cruel little eyes, as if
inviting him to just try it.</p>
<p>So Thad had to suspend operations until Bruin,
overtaken by a desire to once more revel in the
camp-stores, shuffled back again to the neighborhood
of the twin tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t coax him over here again, please, Allan,&rdquo;
remarked the scoutmaster, who was now busily
engaged &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; with that looped cord, trying to
drop the noose over the end of the little rifle, which,
by a rare chance, was raised a few inches from the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>The other scouts were all watching his labor,
being deeply interested in the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got a bite, Thad!&rdquo; called out
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to him, Thad!&rdquo; advised Step Hen.</p>
<p>But the fisherman was too cautious to risk so
much. He wanted to slip the noose a little further
along, before he made a final jerk, in order to try
and tighten it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his eye on you, Thad!&rdquo; warned
Smithy, whose tree happened to be better located
for observation than any of the other ones appropriated
by his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there he&rsquo;s coming over to see what you
mean by that string hanging down,&rdquo; asserted
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody draw his attention!&rdquo; called out
Thad. &ldquo;Make him think you&rsquo;re meaning to drop
down. It will give me the chance I need to finish
my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, throw Bumpus down, Step Hen!&rdquo; called
out Giraffe. &ldquo;He was the cause of all this trouble
and he ought to sacrifice himself now, in order to
create a diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from me! Don&rsquo;t you dare touch
me, Step Hen! I&rsquo;ll pull you down along with me,
if you try to do that,&rdquo; cried Bumpus, really alarmed.</p>
<p>But Allan caught the idea Thad advanced. Besides,
it just happened that he was well situated
for carrying it out. By going through some extravagant
motions, as though about to descend, he
caught the attention of the bear, which immediately
shuffled over to his tree, and looked up expectantly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad was not idle.</p>
<p>He saw what he had to do in order to make a
sure thing of his work. Moving to one side a little,
as the nature of his hold in the branches of the tree
permitted, he jerked at his line until the loop actually
closed tightly on the barrel of Step Hen&rsquo;s rifle.
After that it should not be a difficult task to pull
the weapon up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Thad, he&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; shouted the excited
Giraffe.</p>
<p>In spite of all Allan&rsquo;s cutting-up the bear seemed
to think that he had better be paying more attention
to what was going on elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thad had raised the gun from the ground. It
was slowly ascending through space, and turning
around as it came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>The grizzly hurried underneath, while Thad
hastened to pass the cord through his fingers and
when the wise old bear, seeming to understand the
case, reared up to strike at the dangling rifle, he
just managed to give it a tap that started it to
spinning around at a lively clip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Giraffe, under the belief that all
was lost.</p>
<p>But Thad had made one last drag, and even as
the other uttered that exclamation the scoutmaster
snatched the gun out of the air; for with that very
last pull, the noose seemed to have slipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Thad wins!&rdquo; burst out from Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, old Charlie!&rdquo; mocked Bumpus.
&ldquo;Better skip out while there is time, if you know
what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bear did not seem to be that wise. He
remained there, winking those wicked little eyes
up at Thad, as if daring him to do his worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to him, Thad!&rdquo; begged Giraffe, so impatient
that he could hardly understand why the
more careful boy should wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>But although Thad had never up to now
encountered a wild grizzly, he had heard and read
a great deal about them. And thus he knew that
at times such an animal can be shot full of bullets,
so to speak, without killing him, so tenacious of life
is the grizzly bear of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>On this account, therefore, Thad wished to make
all the capital possible out of the six bullets that
were contained in Step Hen&rsquo;s gun.</p>
<p>Waiting until a good opportunity presented itself,
he took a quick aim, and then pulled the
trigger. With the report there came a tremendous
roar, so savage, so full of pent-up animal rage,
that Bumpus immediately proceeded to climb up to
a still higher limb of the tree in which he had found
shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down! No, he&rsquo;s up again! Give him
another, Thad! Oh! don&rsquo;t I wish I had my Old
Reliable here, though,&rdquo; cried Giraffe.</p>
<p>Thad was awake to the necessity for prompt
action. The bear, even though desperately
wounded, was still full of fight. And there could
be no telling what the maddened animal might not
attempt, if given time.</p>
<p>Thad taking careful aim fired again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>He really felt an admiration for the hard-fighting
grizzly, such as all hunters worthy of the name experience
toward the four-footed enemy that puts up
a game battle for its life.</p>
<p>There were four more bullets in the repeating
rifle, and Thad had to make use of them all before
he could really feel he had caused the last vital
spark to flee from its abiding-place in the body of
the shaggy monster.</p>
<p>But after the sixth and last shot had been fired,
there was silence on the part of the terror of the
mountain gulches. The grizzly&rsquo;s last convulsive
movement had taken place. No longer would his
savage roar, echoing from cliff to cliff, cause all
other wild animals to flee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, as he dropped to
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he surely dead?&rdquo; asked Smithy, from his
perch aloft.</p>
<p>For answer the reckless Giraffe ran up, and
placed a foot on the motionless body of the bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">BUMPUS TAKES A CHANCE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s getting bears but me,&rdquo; Bumpus
was saying on the following day, when, a new
camp having been selected, further removed from
the noise of the rapids, the boys decided to stay
over for a little while, and try their luck hunting
through the big timber lands around them.</p>
<p>The two runaway pack mules had been recovered.
Just as the boys expected, the trailing stakes had
become caught fast in the rocks that lay up the
stream, and in which direction the panic-stricken
pack animals had gone. Both were found before
darkness set in, and escorted back in triumph to the
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>The boys had also discovered that hungry trout
lay in schools below the foaming rapids, just anxious
to grace the frying-pan of the scouts. And the
savory mess they had secured for breakfast that
morning was one of the reasons why, upon putting
the question to a vote, it was decided to stay over a
while.</p>
<p>And after they had located the new camp, with
the tents erected, and things looking fairly comfortable,
the complaining voice of Bumpus was heard
in the land, as he rubbed diligently at the shining
barrels of his Marlin with an oiled rag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you had your chance, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded
Step Hen, with a wink and a nod in the
direction of Thad, who had paused to listen, while
stretching the great skin of the grizzly on a big
frame, to start drying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I did; but he was too far away for my
buckshot to bring him down,&rdquo; declared Bumpus;
&ldquo;but I hit him, didn&rsquo;t I, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In eight different places by actual count,&rdquo; replied
the other. &ldquo;Altogether this pelt is shot so
full of holes it won&rsquo;t make the finest rug going;
but whenever we look at it on the floor of our
armory we&rsquo;ll all remember the queer kind of fruit
the trees out here bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is Giraffe, now,&rdquo; went on Bumpus, still
hugging his grievance to his heart; &ldquo;he got a black
bear when we were up in Maine, but I call that just
a snap. The old thief was astealin&rsquo; honey from
the tree we cut down, when Giraffe, he just plunked
him. Why, my dandy gun would have knocked
that bear over at such close range, the easiest ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it would, Bumpus,&rdquo; said Thad, consolingly,
&ldquo;and sometime, perhaps you&rsquo;ll have your
chance. We all hope you will, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see to it that I do,&rdquo; grumbled the
fat scout; and from his manner one would be apt
to think that really life was becoming very tame,
and hardly worth having, unless he might find his
one great wish gratified.</p>
<p>Bumpus really felt his failure of the preceding
night very keenly. It was not often that any of the
boys had seen him so sober and sour.</p>
<p>He felt as though a cruel fate had taken pleasure
in cheating him out of honors he should have
claimed. That ought to have been <i>his</i> bear, by
right of first discovery; and also because he had
fired both barrels of his Marlin at the beast, and
actually knocked him over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The trouble was, old Charlie did not know enough
to stay down; but had persisted in giving them
further trouble, until Thad engineered that clever
scheme for getting possession of a gun, when immediately
the game was up.</p>
<p>Had Thad ever dreamed of what a tenacious hold
this newly-acquired desire to shine as a mighty
Nimrod, had taken upon the mind of Bumpus, he
would certainly have been more careful about leaving
the tenderfoot to his own devices.</p>
<p>The morning was still young when Giraffe proposed
that they make up a party, to take a look
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows but what we might run across a
deer; or one of those Rocky Mountain big-horn
sheep?&rdquo; he added, as a clincher to his argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along to help tote your game,&rdquo; remarked
Bob White.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m in the ring,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen.
&ldquo;Why, my mouth&rsquo;s just watering for some prime
mutton chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad smiled. He knew that if ever they did
secure a big-horn, the flesh of that high jumping
animal would probably be as tough as leather, unless
fortunately they chanced upon a young one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>It was finally arranged that besides Thad and
Allan, Step Hen, Giraffe and Bob White should
make up the hunting party.</p>
<p>This would leave three in camp&mdash;Smithy who
had no gun, Davy Jones, whose head still felt sore
from the effect of his accident on the previous afternoon;
and the despondent Bumpus, who was acting
very strangely, for one of his cheery disposition.</p>
<p>No one dreamed that any trouble could come
upon the camp while part of the scouts were away.
Two of those who remained owned guns, though
at the last moment Davy Jones forced Bob White
to carry his &ldquo;pump&rdquo; shot gun. But then, what
was there to fear? If the mate of the slain grizzly
came around, looking for the absent one, the boys
had been instructed to take to the trees; and Thad
had even gone to the trouble of picking out the
best fortress available in this line, one that even the
clumsy Bumpus could readily climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you could shin up that tree, in case
the other old Mountain Charlie came prowling
around?&rdquo; Thad asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I guess I could,&rdquo; replied the other, rather
indifferently, Thad thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, Bumpus,&rdquo; called out Step Hen,
&ldquo;if I was you I&rsquo;d fix it so&rsquo;s to have my ammunition
up in that tree. Then, you see, if he sat down at the
butt here, to wait till you got ripe and dropped, why,
you could just keep banging away till you loaded
him so full of little bullets he couldn&rsquo;t get up off the
ground. Great stunt, ain&rsquo;t it boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others readily declared that it was making
things easy for Bumpus. They were even kind
enough to express a wish that another bear <i>would</i>
take a notion to come around, just to please Bumpus,
for it pained them exceedingly to see him looking
so miserable.</p>
<p>But the fat boy did not grow at all enthusiastic
over Step Hen&rsquo;s proposal. He just watched all
the preparations being made for the hunt; and sitting
there on the log, kept polishing his gun, although
it certainly showed no speck of rust or
grime.</p>
<p>Presently all of them were ready to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be nice now,&rdquo; said Thad, before departing,
&ldquo;if some of you camp-keepers gave those
trout another try. We may not get a shot at a deer
all the time we&rsquo;re gone; and if we fail on fresh
meat, another mess of trout would taste pretty
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say they would, whether we strike
game or not,&rdquo; declared Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t tasted anything so good since we were
up in Maine last fall, and had just one mess before
the trout season closed,&rdquo; Allan observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and accommodate you as far as I&rsquo;m
able,&rdquo; Smithy agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; echoed Davy Jones.</p>
<p>But as for Bumpus, good-natured, jolly Bumpus,
he seemed to have lost his tongue, for he failed to
add his promise to that of the other two scouts.</p>
<p>Thad looked at him as he turned away. He had
never dreamed that the fat scout would take anything
so much to heart. Bumpus was not cut out
for a good hunter, either by instinct or bodily favor.
Some of his enemies in Cranford, like Brose Griffin
and Eli Bangs, were wont to say that Bumpus was
not only ponderous of body, but &ldquo;fat-witted&rdquo; as
well, by which they probably meant his mind was
slow to act.</p>
<p>Still, there have been successful fat hunters.
Bumpus knew, for he had made it a point to investigate
in every way possible, and he was resolved
that he would shine as a successful Nimrod, despite
the disadvantages under which he labored. So
much the more credit to him when he finally proved
his right to boast that proud title.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>After the five hunters went away, Smithy found
some bait, and wandered down to the base of the
rapids to fish. The gentle art of angling was more
in the line of the dude of the patrol than tramping
through the big timber after elusive game.</p>
<p>Here Davy Jones presently joined him, saying
that Bumpus had urged him to add a second rod and
line to that Smithy already had out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get him to try it, though,&rdquo; said Davy.
&ldquo;Told me he was no fisherman, and nearly always
fell in, he was that clumsy. And between us,
Smithy, that&rsquo;s pretty near the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can remember several occasions when
Bumpus made a splash that he didn&rsquo;t calculate on,&rdquo;
remarked Smithy, who was usually just as careful
of his language as he was of his clothes, and no one
could ever remember ever hearing him utter any
slang phrase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Meanwhile the five hunters had gone off in high
spirits. The day was glorious, and a whole month
of this sort of thing stared them in the face. That
was enough to make any bunch of boys happy, especially
when they cared as much for the Great
Outdoors as Thad and his chums did.</p>
<p>Allan was a born hunter. What he did not know
about stalking game and all such things that a successful
hunter must be up in, the boys had not as
yet learned.</p>
<p>He had noted the passing clouds, and observed
the direction in which the prevailing wind blew. It
was of considerable moment for the success of their
fresh meat hunt, that they go <i>up</i> the breeze. In this
way they would avoid having their presence in the
timber made known in advance to the wary game,
through the medium of the wonderful sense of smell
which most animals possess.</p>
<p>The five scouts spread out at times in the shape
of a fan, so as to cover as much ground as possible.</p>
<p>Again they would come together for a little consultation,
when they could compare notes; and those
who were not very much experienced in still hunting,
pick up more or less valuable pointers.</p>
<p>Noon came, but as yet they had not met with
any success. Around them the tall trees grew
thickly, and some of them had trunks of such girth
that the scouts easily understood why this region
was always referred to as the &ldquo;big timber.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>As they ascended higher up the slopes of the foothills
that bordered the Rockies, they would find the
trees growing smaller all the while, until far up the
heights the stunted mesquite or the dwarfed cedar
alone remained.</p>
<p>Not at all dismayed, after they had refreshed
themselves with the lunch brought for that purpose,
the young hunters again started out.</p>
<p>The wind had veered somewhat, and with this
fresh start they changed their own course, so as to
keep it coming toward them. Thad was just as well
pleased, for this new direction would serve to keep
them within a few miles of camp; and in case they
did manage to secure meat, they would not have
so far to transport it.</p>
<p>Still the time kept slipping away, and the sun
could hardly have been more than two hours above
the western horizon when suddenly a buck was
started. Every one was so eager to get in a shot,
that a regular volley rang out immediately.</p>
<p>There was positively no chance for the poor deer.
He went down in a heap, and was so near dead
when he reached the ground that he did not even
give a last expiring kick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Of course the boys were delighted, especially
when Allan declared their united quarry was a nice
young buck, and that his flesh ought by all rights be
tender.</p>
<p>Using the greatest dispatch the deer was soon cut
up. And when the various packages of meat had
been judiciously distributed, the five scouts started
on their return to camp.</p>
<p>Thanks to the knowledge of woodcraft possessed
by Allan and Thad, they managed to make the
camp on a line as straight as an arrow, almost. Indeed,
Thad declared that a bee laden with honey,
could make no more direct drive for the hive than
Allan had in leading them toward the region of the
camp.</p>
<p>It was just beginning to get a little dusk when
they sighted the crackling fire, and hurrying along,
entered camp. Thad looked around. Davy was
busy over the fire, and the delightful smell of frying
trout told what his occupation must be. Smithy
was cutting up some small wood with the camp-hatchet.
Both looked up as the hunters came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bumpus?&rdquo; asked Thad, quickly scenting
trouble.</p>
<p>Davy and Smithy exchanged glances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We hoped he&rsquo;d found you, and come back,&rdquo; observed
the former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found us? What do you mean by that?&rdquo; demanded
the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went down to the foot of the pool to fish,&rdquo;
explained Davy. &ldquo;An hour later I came back to
get another hook, and I found that Bumpus had
disappeared, taking his gun with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad and Allan exchanged worried glances.
With night at hand and that clumsy tenderfoot lost
somewhere in the big timber, it was no wonder that
a sense of impending trouble, that might yet end in
tragedy, oppressed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">THE MISSING TENDERFOOT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like poor old Bumpus is lost,&rdquo; said
Allan, presently, breaking the silence that had fallen
upon them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost&mdash;whew!&rdquo; muttered Giraffe, with a suggestive
whistle, and an elevation of the eyebrows
that stood for a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That big booby lost!&rdquo; said Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth can we do?&rdquo; Smithy asked.</p>
<p>Again they looked at each other.</p>
<p>Consternation had undoubtedly fallen upon the
camp of the scouts, just as though a wet blanket had
suddenly been thrown on some pet project. It
would have been a matter of more or less concern
had Davy Jones failed to turn up after a day&rsquo;s hunt
in the big timber, or Giraffe, or Step Hen; but Bumpus,
why, no one save himself had ever seriously
contemplated the possibility of the fat boy going
astray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>And yet, now that they thought of it, how many
times had they heard him prophesying that if ever
he <i>did</i> find himself wandering about alone, he
would know how to take care of himself? Bumpus
had for a long time been making preparations looking
to such a happening. The remembrance of this
seemed to cheer the others up a little, after the first
shock had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always dreading just this same thing,&rdquo;
said Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And getting ready against the evil day,&rdquo; remarked
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was why he bought his little compass,&rdquo;
put in Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto his camp hatchet,&rdquo; added Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I reckon, suh,&rdquo; observed the Southern boy,
&ldquo;that Bumpus had it in mind more than anything
else when he took to carrying that piece of window
sash cord around with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Giraffe went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard him
say it was apt to come in handy lots of times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it did,&rdquo; broke in Davy Jones, earnestly.
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that same handy rope, fellows,
there&rsquo;s no telling what would have happened
to <i>me</i>; or what gloom might be ahangin&rsquo; over this
here camp right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Bumpus!&rdquo; murmured Smithy, quite
affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always willing to do his share of the work.
You never knew him to shirk, or get a cramp in the
stomach,&rdquo; and as Giraffe said this he cast a severe
look over in the direction of Davy Jones, who
turned red in the face, gave a little uneasy laugh,
and hastened to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that joke is ancient history now, Giraffe,
I&rsquo;ve reformed since I joined the patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some years before, the Jones boy had really
been subject to violent cramps that gave him
great pain, and doubled him up like a jack-knife,
or a closed hinge. He was always an object
of pity at such times, and had frequently been
allowed to go home from school because of his
affliction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>But the time came when the teacher observed that
these convenient &ldquo;cramps&rdquo; never arrived on a
rainy day; and also that Davy recovered in a miraculous
fashion, once he reached the open air. And
when Davy was simply allowed to retire to a cloak
room, to let the &ldquo;spasm&rdquo; pass, instead of being
started homeward, it was noticed that his complaint
quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>So on joining the scouts, Davy, whose dislike for
exerting himself had been his weakness, began to
have those strange &ldquo;cramps&rdquo; whenever some hard
work was to be done.</p>
<p>But trust boys for noticing that the pains never,
never attacked him when a meal was awaiting attention.
And Davy was soon made so ashamed of
himself that he did actually &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; as he now
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Smithy went on to say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some satisfaction,
anyhow, to know the poor old elephant is
so well fixed, if he does have to pass a night or two
in the woods alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He evidently took a lot of grub and matches
along,&rdquo; said Davy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if he has a fire, he can do without his
blanket,&rdquo; Allan observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re pitying him in this way, how do
we know but what it may be the best thing in the
world for Bumpus,&rdquo; suggested Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he needs something like this to give him
self-reliance. Bumpus was always ready to follow
at the heels of some one who led; but who ever
knew him to start out on his own hook?&rdquo; said
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could be sure of finding him again,
after a couple of days had gone by, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
so bad,&rdquo; declared Smithy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll tell his folks?&rdquo; asked Davy Jones, dejectedly.</p>
<p>Thad turned on him like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, we don&rsquo;t want any of that sort of talk,&rdquo;
he said, severely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to find our missing
comrade again, all right. Get that fixed in your
mind, Davy. It may be to-morrow, or the day
after, or even a week from now, but we&rsquo;ll find him
sooner or later, and he&rsquo;ll know more than he ever
did before, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet he will,&rdquo; chuckled Giraffe, as he
mentally pictured the fat boy stalking through that
great tract of timber, solemnly consulting his compass
from time to time, and yet utterly unable to
say whether the camp lay to the north, south, east
or west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll just be the making of Bumpus, fellers,&rdquo;
ventured Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;if he disappeared
this morning, how is it you two, Davy and
Smithy, let the whole afternoon go by without trying
to communicate with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy Jones took it upon himself to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Thad,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in the first place
we didn&rsquo;t know for sure the poor old silly was
lost, till late in the afternoon. We just kinder felt
a bit uneasy, but every time I came to camp after
fishin&rsquo; an hour or so, I expected to see him sitting
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you grew uneasy, it ought to have been
your business to call us in?&rdquo; continued Thad, as
the leader of the patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, boss,&rdquo; Davy went on to say, &ldquo;but
you see, it happened that I let Bob White take
my gun; and when Bumpus, he let that silly notion
to wander get a strangle hold on him, why, he
carried off the only other shooting iron we had in
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;of course. You did all
right, Davy. And besides, there&rsquo;s a little chance
right now, that Bumpus, in wandering around, may
glimpse our fire here, and come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on that account you mean we ought to
keep a bumper blaze going all evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe, eagerly.</p>
<p>Giraffe&rsquo;s weakness lay in his adoration of fire.
It was forever on his mind, and whenever he sat
down to rest, his always keen-edged jack-knife was
busy whittling shavings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we might want to make a fire later on,
who knows; and then these shavings will come in
real handy,&rdquo; he would say.</p>
<p>He knew about every means possible for producing
a blaze without the use of matches. The
patrol leader, afraid lest Giraffe set the woods
afire up in Maine, where the law is very particular
about such things, had given Giraffe the job of official
fire-maker for the camp on condition that he
agreed never to carry matches on his person, but
to ask for them as needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>This put Giraffe on his mettle.</p>
<p>He began experimenting, first with a burning
sun-glass, and a pinch of powder to start a blaze in
the dry tinder. Then he had used flint and steel
successfully. And from this old-time method he
advanced along the line, making fires in half a
dozen primitive ways, until he came up against one
that &ldquo;stumped&rdquo; him for a long time.</p>
<p>This was the South Sea Island method of producing
heat by friction. The scout had studied it
well, made him a little bow, and spent many hours
twirling the stick that was rolled back and forward
by the cord.</p>
<p>How success finally came, and at a time when it
seemed Giraffe really needed a fire, if ever he did in
all his life, has been already told in a previous volume
of this series.</p>
<p>But the passion for a fire was just as much a part
of Giraffe&rsquo;s nature as it had ever been. And this
was why his face lighted up, while his eyes glittered
with happiness, when he heard the acting scoutmaster
admit they ought to keep a good fire going
all evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Trust Giraffe for that; a wink was as good as
a nod to him, when the subject of fire-building was
concerned.</p>
<p>Later on, they sat around enjoying the venison
steaks, and the trout which had been so beautifully
browned in the frying-pan, after several slices of
fat salt pork had been &ldquo;tried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you putting that lot aside for,
Davy?&rdquo; asked Thad; just as if he did not know
the generous thought which impelled the cook to
reserve one good big portion of the supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought that mebbe Bumpus might poke
along after a bit,&rdquo; replied Davy, adding another
crisp trout to the pile he had heaped up, &ldquo;and if he
does, I guess he&rsquo;s apt to be pretty hungry. Bumpus
is a good feeder, we all know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye suppose made him do it, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the scoutmaster, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the question.
None of us really know; but we can give a
pretty good guess, eh, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, yes,&rdquo; spoke up Giraffe. &ldquo;Bumpus
has gone clean crazy over this bear business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Said everybody was getting them but him,&rdquo; put
in Smithy; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure that doesn&rsquo;t apply to me
in the least. I never expect to get a bear; and my
only hope is that no bear will get me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even if he didn&rsquo;t actually say the words.&rdquo;
went on Giraffe, &ldquo;his manner stood for it all right&mdash;&lsquo;you
just wait, and I&rsquo;m going to have my chance
before long.&rsquo; And fellers, it&rsquo;s my opinion Bumpus
just got tired of waiting for his chance to come to
him, so he went out stalkin&rsquo; after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to pick up his trail to-night, is
there?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>Thad shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
wait until morning, and hope he may show up yet.
As I said before, we&rsquo;ll try and keep a fire going all
night, so as to show him a beacon, if by good luck
he keeps on turning to the left, as lost people nearly
always do, and comes back this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat up rather late, talking. And although
the conversation might be of things that had happened
in the past, it was easy to see what the chief
thought in every one of those boys&rsquo; minds must be;
for never did a rabbit or a squirrel rustle the near-by
underbrush that there did not come a look of eager
expectancy upon seven faces, that quickly died out
again with repeated disappointments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>There is an old saying to the effect that &ldquo;you
never miss the water till the well runs dry.&rdquo; And
these seven scouts of the Silver Fox Patrol did not
fully realize what a universal favorite Bumpus
Hawtree had become until he was missing from
camp.</p>
<p>Many times that night when either Allan or
Thad, being light sleepers, took it upon themselves
to crawl out from their blanket in the tent they occupied,
to fix the smouldering fire, they would sit
there a bit, and listen to see if by good luck they
might hear a distant &ldquo;halloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But only the usual noises of the night greeted
them. Around lay the mysterious big timber, and
somewhere in the unknown depths of this wide
stretch of woods bordering the Rocky Mountain
foothills their comrade was camping in solitude,
doubtless a prey to lively fears.</p>
<p>So morning found them.</p>
<p>Breakfast was quickly eaten. There was no
&ldquo;cutting up,&rdquo; or boyish pranks shown on this
morning. Every one seemed serious, gloomy, oppressed
with doubts, and a vague sense of coming
trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Thad saw to it that a complete understanding was
arranged with the three who were to remain in
camp, being Davy Jones, Bob White and Smithy.</p>
<p>And then the others, having each made up a few
rations of food to carry them over possibly a couple
of days, prepared to start upon the plain trail of
Bumpus, which had been easily found.</p>
<p>A last wave of the hand, a few &ldquo;good luck go
with you&rsquo;s,&rdquo; from the boys in the camp, and then
the trackers were swallowed up in the big timber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">FORCED TO THINK FOR HIMSELF.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What time d&rsquo;ye suppose it is, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen asked the question. Perhaps he was a
little tired himself, for the four scouts had been
constantly on the go since early morning, and it
was now getting well on into the afternoon.</p>
<p>They had kept on the zigzag trail left by Bumpus.
As a rule it had been very easy following, and
afforded all of them considerable enjoyment, because
Bumpus knew nothing at all concerning the
art of hiding a trail, and would have had no object
in doing so, even had he been educated along this
line.</p>
<p>But there were times when it happened that the
formation of the ground interfered to some extent
with their making progress, since even Allan and
Thad had considerable to learn about reading signs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! about four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied Thad, and instead
of consulting his little nickel watch when saying
this, he cast a quick glance upward to where a
glimpse of the sun could be obtained through an
opening in the tops of the exceedingly tall trees.</p>
<p>Thus the habit of observation is encouraged in
a scout. He learns to depend less upon the devices
of civilization, and more on such natural resources
as the primitive folks enjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how close you came to it,&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe, as he took out the cheap but effective dollar
watch the patrol leader carried. &ldquo;Well, now, what
d&rsquo;ye think of that for hittin&rsquo; the bull&rsquo;s eye plumb in
the center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the watch up to show that the hands
pointed exactly to four. Thad laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I couldn&rsquo;t hit it as close as that in a
dozen times,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s always easy
to get pretty near the hour, day or night, if you only
fall into the habit of noticing where the sun, moon
or stars should be. There isn&rsquo;t a time in the night,
if the sky happens to be clear, but what I can tell
you the hour within ten minutes anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we gained any on Bumpus?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe.</p>
<p>At this question the scoutmaster shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say we don&rsquo;t seem to gain any,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Where we picked up some at times,
we lost again when the trail got faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! looks like an endless task, then,&rdquo; grunted
Step Hen. &ldquo;Bumpus keeps tramping along, every
day, and when night comes we&rsquo;re just the same distance
behind. Seems to me we&rsquo;ll just never get
him at that rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Thad, not at all dismayed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
just keep at it, you know. Lots of things are apt
to happen to help us. Bumpus will tire out soon.
Then he may get discouraged, and just make up his
mind to stay in camp till we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would be a mighty sensible thing for
him to do,&rdquo; declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t fetch him his bear,&rdquo; chuckled
Giraffe, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the one thing worth living for
with Bumpus right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he&rsquo;s got over the fever,&rdquo; suggested Step
Hen. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps a reaction has set in by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, anyhow,&rdquo; remarked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Bumpus was about here yesterday at
four <span class="sc">P. M.</span>,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wonder where
he is now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; added Step Hen. &ldquo;One
thing sure, he hadn&rsquo;t run across that bear of his up
to this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I take it was a lucky thing for Bumpus,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; Thad went on to say,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve still got the trail in front of us, and it seems
to lead across that boggy stretch ahead. Here&rsquo;s
where he walked along the edge. Then for some
reason or other he started to cross over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I take it was a fool play for Bumpus,&rdquo;
grunted Giraffe. &ldquo;Chances are a fellow of his
heft would get stuck in the mud and mired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he thought he saw his bear on the other
side,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen.</p>
<p>Thad had plunged in, regardless of the mud.
Where Bumpus went it seemed to be their duty to
follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! wouldn&rsquo;t this give Smithy a heartache
though?&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, when the mud came
half way to their knees, and seemed so sticky that
it was only through some exertion that they lifted
each foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, much as he&rsquo;d hate to do it,&rdquo; Thad observed,
proudly, &ldquo;Smithy would follow wherever
his leader went. He&rsquo;s learned the rules by which
all true scouts are governed, and obedience is one of
them. What is it, Allan?&rdquo; he went on, as the other
uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up, don&rsquo;t go a step further!&rdquo; called out
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen, getting
his gun ready, and casting a glance up at the
branches of the trees as though he half expected to
see a sleek gray panther crouched in a fork, ready
to pounce down upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the dry mud splattered on the trunk of
that tree;&rdquo; continued Allan, pointing.</p>
<p>And after they had looked, the four scouts exchanged
horrified glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sink hole!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, turning
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poor old Bumpus was caught in the mud.
He splashed around like a stranded porpoise, and
that threw the stuff up on that tree trunk,&rdquo; Step
Hen went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it can&rsquo;t be as bad as that, can it, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Giraffe in a tremulous tone, as his eyes remained
glued on the treacherous surface of the bog
about the place where Bumpus had been caught and
held as in a vise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Was it possible their poor comrade could have
sunk out of sight under that smooth deceptive surface?
The thought was too terrible.</p>
<p>All at once Thad uttered a cry, and the others
noticed that it seemed to have a little ring of joy
about it, rather than gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold my gun and my haversack, fellows,&rdquo; said
the patrol leader.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the others he started to climb
a tree that had low limbs some of them not more
than eight feet above the surface of the bog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the dickens is he up to?&rdquo; exclaimed
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch, and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Allan went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Allan?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give a guess, but I don&rsquo;t want to spoil it
all by telling,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;Both of you
stand right where you are, and don&rsquo;t move a foot
ahead, or you may get in the same trouble Bumpus
did, and without his means of crawling out of the
hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these mysterious words Giraffe and Step Hen
exchanged looks of amazement. They could not
for the life of them imagine Bumpus capable of
doing anything that would be beyond them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, Thad&rsquo;s managed to get to a place just
above where Bumpus must have been stuck,&rdquo; Allan
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually laughing!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s struck you as funny, Thad?&rdquo; called out
Giraffe, unable to hold in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as sure as you live, boys, he did it,&rdquo; replied
the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; demanded both Step Hen and
Giraffe in concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got out of the muck bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he, Thad? That limb must a
been two feet above his head when he stood there
knee deep or more, in the mud. Tell us how?&rdquo;
pleaded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the plain marks,&rdquo; Thad went on,
&ldquo;where the bark of the tree was bruised, as it had
a right to be with such a heavy weight as Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marks!&rdquo; repeated Giraffe. &ldquo;Good gracious!
hurry up and tell us. Marks of what, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rope!&rdquo; replied the other, still laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rope! Bumpus used his blessed old rope to
drag himself out of the mud sink! Well, well, well,
if that don&rsquo;t beat the Dutch,&rdquo; Giraffe cried out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It reflects great credit on Bumpus,&rdquo; said the
scoutmaster, warmly. &ldquo;He must have quickly
made up his mind that he could only sink deeper
in by keeping up his floundering. Then that nice
limb above his head caught his eye, and he remembered
about the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for Bumpus,&rdquo; cried Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to call him my comrade,&rdquo; added Step
Hen, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have taxed him a whole lot to drag himself
up,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s so heavy, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case of &lsquo;root hog, or die,&rsquo; I take it,&rdquo; Step
Hen remarked; &ldquo;and when he had to face the
music Bumpus proved real game. You&rsquo;re sure he
made it, are you, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps of evidence to that effect,&rdquo; replied the
other. &ldquo;Rope&rsquo;s gone, in the first place. Then
here&rsquo;s dried mud a plenty, showing that our pard
was in this tree. I can even see which way he went,
by the marks he left; and he was determined enough
to cross the slough, for he kept right on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you follow him in the trees, Thad,&rdquo;
sang out Allan, &ldquo;while we hunt a better place to
cross over without getting mired. We&rsquo;ll join you
later. Give a call when you&rsquo;ve landed, and got his
trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; commended the patrol leader. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
busy here then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began climbing along the limb, and succeeded
in safely passing into the adjoining tree, just as
Bumpus must have done. How the clumsy fat boy
had succeeded in carrying out these capers puzzled
the agile Thad, for at times it tried even his agility
to make progress.</p>
<p>But Thad was delighted to know that Bumpus,
upon being thrown on his own resources, could
make good.</p>
<p>Before a great while his loud call announced to
the others, who had just succeeded in finding a safe
ford across the water and mud, that Thad was once
more on the ground, and ready to take up the trail.</p>
<p>The little party started on again.</p>
<p>Both Giraffe and Step Hen were filled with secret
admiration for the stout comrade whom they had
always been in the habit of rather looking down on
as a good-natured fellow, but rather incapable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t for the life of me see how he ever done
it,&rdquo; Giraffe would say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beats everything, and after this we ain&rsquo;t got
any business to look on Bumpus as a big baby. He
got out of that hole just fine,&rdquo; Step Hen would
add.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Allan came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashes of a fire!&rdquo; he remarked, pointing to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s where Bumpus must a spent last
night?&rdquo; suggested Step Hen, looking curiously
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what he had to eat?&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! plenty of grub,&rdquo; Thad said, laughingly.
&ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s the rind from a slice of our ham.
Davy said he&rsquo;d cut some off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of the nerve of him,&rdquo; declared Step Hen.
&ldquo;But I just can see this rough experience is goin&rsquo;
to be the makin&rsquo; of Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me of the story of the bull pup,&rdquo; remarked
Thad, laughing. &ldquo;You know, the boy had
brought home a young bulldog, and the old man,
to encourage the pup, had gone down on his hands
and knees to bark at him, when the dog grabbed
him by the nose and held on like fun. And while
the old man was trying to break away, the boy was
sicking the dog on, all the time shouting: &lsquo;Stand
it, dad, stand it as long as you can, because it&rsquo;s
going to be the making of the pup!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Allen had been bending over the fire while all this
talk was going on. He now looked up to remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he stuck several potatoes in his bag, too,
before he started out,&rdquo; and he held up a couple of
blackened skins, showing that the interior had been
gauged out after the potatoes had been baked in
the hot ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Bumpus, he&rsquo;s learning to take care of
himself fast,&rdquo; cried Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; remarked Allan, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus shows he&rsquo;s bound to be something of
a hunter yet,&rdquo; declared Allan, &ldquo;and what he learned
up in Maine has been in his mind ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean about leaving fires burning when
breaking camp, and the danger of the wind carrying
the hot ashes among the dead leaves?&rdquo; the
scoutmaster went on to say, for he had eyes of his
own, and had been watching Allan&rsquo;s actions even
while talking with the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do mean,&rdquo; the other continued.
&ldquo;In the first place Bumpus knew enough
to make his camp close to running water, so he
could get a drink whenever he wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see he did,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, glancing
toward the gurgling little stream that ran not
twenty feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he left here this morning,&rdquo; continued
Allan, &ldquo;he made sure to carry water from
the creek and sprinkle the fire till it was dead.
Look, you can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s been wet
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray for Bumpus!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see him passing the examination for a
first-class scout some of these fine days,&rdquo; added
Step Hen. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever think it of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed on once more, after Allan had even
shown them the very stick on one end of which
Bumpus had thrust his slice of smoked ham, and
cooked it, after a fashion. Step Hen put it up to
his nose, and vouched for the accuracy of Allan&rsquo;s
assertion.</p>
<p>But all the boys were a little tired, and when it
grew too dark under the trees to see the trail of
the lost tenderfoot they eagerly welcomed Thad&rsquo;s
suggestion that they rest up for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>So Giraffe was instructed to build a cooking fire
at a certain place. It happened to be in a little
natural basin, and here the four boys ate their supper,
over which they talked earnestly, but there was
no hilarity.</p>
<p>Later on while the others were partly done with
their meal, Allan left the circle and said he would
take a little stroll. He went up the rise, as though
desirous of seeing what lay beyond.</p>
<p>The moon was about three-quarters full, and
hung in the eastern sky; but under the big trees
it was almost dark.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward Allan came hurrying back,
declaring that he had discovered what looked to be
a lone camp-fire, at some distance away in the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Bumpus,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen,
eagerly, jumping up, although still hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t go far on the second day, or
else he&rsquo;s been traveling in a circle and got back near
where he started out from,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head over that way,&rdquo; Step Hen went on to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And surprise him, eh? That&rsquo;s the ticket, boys,&rdquo;
Giraffe continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That fire is a good long ways off,&rdquo; warned
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like a star at first, and must be on rising
ground, where the trees are more open,&rdquo; the discoverer
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead us to it. We want to surprise Bumpus,&rdquo;
both the others declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Thad?&rdquo; Allan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing we can do,&rdquo; replied the
scoutmaster. &ldquo;If it proves to be Bumpus, we
hadn&rsquo;t ought to take any chances of losing him again
in the morning. If you&rsquo;re all of the same mind,
let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the fire was carefully extinguished, and Allan
led his comrades to the top of the little rise.
Here he pointed out the object he said was a campfire,
although Giraffe and Step Hen believed they
would have taken it for a star low down near the
horizon, had they noticed it at all.</p>
<p>After their bearings had been carefully taken,
in order that they might head in a direct line for
the fire, they started forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>By degrees the seeming star grew into a light of
the first magnitude, and finally even the two less
experienced scouts were ready to affirm that it must
be a camp-fire.</p>
<p>They kept on going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sure give old Bumpus the biggest surprise
of his life,&rdquo; chuckled Step Hen, as they drew
nearer the place.</p>
<p>Of course they made some noise pushing along
through the almost dark woods, but then Bumpus
would not be apt to hear that. Perhaps the poor
tired fellow was already fast asleep alongside the
fire.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, and the boys were very close
to the blaze. Giraffe thrust up his head above the
bushes, which he was better fitted by Nature for
doing than any of his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see a sign of him about, fellers,&rdquo; he
whispered, ducking down again.</p>
<p>Thereupon the others also raised their heads to
look. There was the fire, burning cheerfully, and
showing that it must have had recent care. But not
a single sign of a human being was to be seen.</p>
<p>It was very strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he heard us coming, and thought it was
a bear,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in that case I guess Bumpus would take to
a tree,&rdquo; Giraffe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we ought to step out right away, and
let him know,&rdquo; came from Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, yes,&rdquo; Giraffe went on, &ldquo;I know
for one I&rsquo;d hate to be peppered with the loads he
carries in that Marlin scatter gun of his. Hello!
there, Bumpus, hold your fire. It&rsquo;s your chums
come to look you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four scouts had arisen to their feet, and were
just about to push out from behind the fringe of
bushes, in order to show themselves to Bumpus,
when they were electrified to hear a voice, gruff and
surly, and certainly not that of their jolly companion,
call loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest hold up yer hands, you fellers, for we&rsquo;ve
sure got ye kivered!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">TURNING THE TABLES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this mean?&rdquo; said Thad, laughingly,
although he did not fail to do as he had been
ordered.</p>
<p>Two rather rough looking men came out of the
scrub, carrying guns which seemed to be handled
rather carelessly, seeing that they were evidently
ready for immediate use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, consarn it all, Pierre, they&rsquo;re on&rsquo;y a pack
o&rsquo; boys arter all, and not sojers,&rdquo; the larger man
exclaimed, staring hard at the four scouts, some of
whom wore various parts of their regular khaki
uniforms, as well as the regulation campaign hat of
the Boy Scout organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sacre!</i> zat ees so,&rdquo; the other man exploded,
and Thad knew instantly from his name and manner
of speech that Pierre must be one of those
French Canadian half-breeds of whom he had heard
so much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we are, my friends,&rdquo; Thad
hastened to remark; &ldquo;we belong to a Boy Scout
troop in the East, and came out here to have a hunt
in the Rockies. One of our number, a very fat boy,
wandered off, and got lost in the big timber. We
were following up his trail, and trying to locate
him, when we discovered a camp-fire over here.
So you see, we walked another mile just to give
our friend a little surprise. But we hope you&rsquo;ll let
us take down our hands now, because it&rsquo;s hard to
hold them up like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men exchanged looks. Then they
lowered the hammers of their guns. The action
signified that, according to their way of thinking,
they had nothing to fear from these half-grown
lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cum an&rsquo; set down an&rsquo; tell us a lot more,&rdquo; said
the big man, with the red face, and the crafty eyes,
Thad could not bring himself to like, because he
seemed to see wells of treachery in their depths.</p>
<p>So the boys dropped down again, being more
foot-weary than ever. But taking a cue from Allan
and Thad, the other two scouts kept their guns
close beside them. Apparently none of them exactly
liked the looks of the two strangers; and they
were not accustomed to much reading of character,
either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;War his name Bumpus?&rdquo; asked the American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was,&rdquo; flashed out Giraffe; &ldquo;but
how did you know that? Have you met up with
our lost pard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! ain&rsquo;t I got ears, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; ye call
out that same name when ye was agoin&rsquo; ter walk
inter our camp?&rdquo; demanded the other, gruffly.</p>
<p>Thad was on the alert.</p>
<p>He did not feel favorably impressed by the looks
of the two men. Besides, he noticed a crafty,
greedy expression cross their faces whenever they
allowed their eyes to rest on Step Hen&rsquo;s new repeating
rifle. Evidently the neatness of the little
weapon quite captured them, and made them envy
the boy its possession.</p>
<p>And Thad was of the opinion that two such
rough-looking customers would not hesitate long
about trying to obtain anything they coveted.</p>
<p>The conversation soon became more general, the
men wanting to know how it was these boys, almost
wholly inexperienced in the ways of the woods
as they took them to be, were venturesome enough
to start into the foothills of the Rockies without a
single guide along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>So Thad explained how they had engaged a pair
of guides, both of whom had disappointed them,
one by getting sick, and the other in taking up with
a couple of big-horn sportsmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we heard of a man up here somewhere,&rdquo;
Thad went on, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d been logger, trapper, timber
cruiser and everything; and people said that if we
could only run across Toby Smathers, and he took
the job, we&rsquo;d have a guide worth any two men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet? Toby Smathers, did ye say?&rdquo;
demanded the other, that crafty look coming into
his face again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the name; do you happen to
know him?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckons now, as none o&rsquo; ye ever run acrost
Toby; air thet right?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never have,&rdquo; replied Thad.</p>
<p>The fellow laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet shore is a fack,&rdquo; he went on to say. &ldquo;Jest
think o&rsquo; it, Pierre Laporte, they&rsquo;s askin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me ef I
ever run acrost Toby Smathers? Ain&rsquo;t thet a good
joke, though? I&rsquo;ve kerried a few names in my day,
younkers, an&rsquo; Toby Smathers be one o&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then you&rsquo;re the very man we&rsquo;ve been looking
for, eh?&rdquo; but while Thad uttered this sentiment,
there did not seem to be any great amount of
enthusiasm in his manner, Allan thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He believes the fellow lies; and I just know it,&rdquo;
Allan was saying to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if so be ye wanter make me a offer, spot
cash, ter guide ye boys through the big timber, find
yer missin&rsquo; chum, and show ye some big-horn huntin&rsquo;
in the Rockies, I&rsquo;m yer man; on&rsquo;y make the
price wuth my while, an&rsquo; cash down, spot cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad said he had no doubt it could be easily arranged
to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.
His object was really to gain time. He had received
a secret sign from Allan, which told him
just as plainly as so many words would have done
that his chum had something of importance to
communicate, as soon as they could get their heads
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Step Hen and Giraffe had apparently swallowed
the story offered by the self-called Toby Smathers
without a suspicion. They were now entertaining
the two men with some accounts of previous experiences.
The fellows seemed to be in high
spirits. They would nudge each other, and laugh
boisterously on the slightest pretense. And sometimes
they would laugh when there was no humorous
story being told; a look exchanged between
them being sufficient grounds for hilarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure enough feeling pretty fine,&rdquo;
thought Thad; &ldquo;and it strikes me they think they&rsquo;ve
got a little joke of their own that they&rsquo;re playing
on us. Three to one it&rsquo;s about that name, too. I
just can&rsquo;t believe that man answers to the description
I&rsquo;ve had of Toby Smathers. Why, they said
he was just the picture of an honest wood&rsquo;s ranger,
employed by the Government to watch out for timber
thieves, forest fires and the likes. And that
man&rsquo;s face would condemn him on sight before any
judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then he heard Allan say he was thirsty, and
must get a drink. The stream ran near by, and
Thad noticed how the cautious Maine boy carried
his gun along with him as he went.</p>
<p>A minute or so later Thad also arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as dry as a bone,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;and I
think I&rsquo;d like a drink about the size of the one
Allan&rsquo;s getting. Wait here, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>He added these last words as a sop to quiet the
suspicions of Pierre and the man who called himself
Toby Smathers. They had frowned, and made an
impatient movement upon noticing that Thad, too,
took his gun along with him, rather a queer thing to
do when only going for a drink.</p>
<p>But Thad&rsquo;s last words apparently served to disarm
their suspicions. They had two of the boys
held as hostages, at any rate.</p>
<p>Thad found his chum much excited. A drink
just then was about the last thing Allan Hollister
was thinking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Thad, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s laugh a little, out loud, so they won&rsquo;t be
suspicious,&rdquo; said the other; and after that clever
dodge had been carried out, he went on to add:
&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t believe what he said about that name,
did you, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s the man we&rsquo;re
looking for up here,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Allan went on, &ldquo;and I know
he&rsquo;s a fraud. He wants to get hold of anything
we have that&rsquo;s worth taking. That gun of Step
Hen&rsquo;s seems to just take his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who he is?&rdquo; demanded Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can give a pretty close guess, now that we
heard the name of his companion, Pierre Laporte,&rdquo;
said Allan. &ldquo;Some men down at the post where
we got the mules told me to look out for a half-breed
by that name, who kept company with an
even worse scoundrel named Hank Dodge. And
this is Hank, all right, make up your mind to that,
Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rascal is written big all over his face, I can
see,&rdquo; the other went on. &ldquo;But what is their line&mdash;just
plain scamps, or timber cruisers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are different kinds of timber scouts or
cruisers, they tell me,&rdquo; Allan continued. &ldquo;Some are
honest men, working for honest lumber dealers.
Others spy out rich tracts on Government land,
which the big company of thieves they&rsquo;re hired by,
want to cut next winter. The Government loses
millions on millions every year that way. And
these crafty fellows are up here looking for timber
that can be easily stolen and marketed next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had we better do?&rdquo; asked Thad. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t be safe for us to spend the night in camp
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; replied Allan earnestly.
&ldquo;If we go in the ordinary way the chances are
they&rsquo;ll jump on us. So I suppose we might as well
up and tell them we know who they are, and that
we don&rsquo;t propose staying any longer in their company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be as mad as hornets,&rdquo; suggested Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;four guns are better
than two, any day. Come on back to the fire
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drew near, Allan whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it right now, Step Hen&rsquo;s rifle, I mean.
Reckon he asked to see it, and our chum handed it
over. Chances are he won&rsquo;t give it back again in a
hurry. There, what did I tell you; he&rsquo;s laid it down
beside him, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our time to cut in, then,&rdquo; said the patrol
leader. &ldquo;You watch out for Pierre, and don&rsquo;t
let him slip up on you, or there&rsquo;ll be heaps of
trouble. Cover him when I do the other. Ready?
Then here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And ten seconds later those by the fire heard
Thad call out in ringing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn, Pierre and Hank Dodge, to
hold up your hands. Quick now, or it&rsquo;ll be the
worse for you. The tables are turned&mdash;up with
them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A SCOUT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE ALERT.</span></h2>
<p>When the young scoutmaster chose to, he could
put a world of meaning in his voice. And those
two timber cruisers, upon seeing both guns covering
them so steadily, doubtless realized that firearms
are no respecter of persons; since a weapon
fired by a lad is just as sure to make good, if held
correctly, as though a mature man looked along the
barrel.</p>
<p>And so they complied with the order, although
grumblingly, and evidently loth to admit that a
couple of boys had gotten the better of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hyars a nice how-d&rsquo;ye-do, treatin&rsquo; yer
guide like he was pizen mean. What d&rsquo;ye mean
by it, younker?&rdquo; growled the man who had claimed
to be Toby Smathers, the forest ranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it only means that we&rsquo;ve guessed who you
are,&rdquo; remarked Thad, calmly. &ldquo;We were warned
down at the post to look out for a couple of unscrupulous
timber cruisers by the name of Hank
Dodge and Pierre Laporte. And we don&rsquo;t want to
have anything to do with you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take keer, young feller, who yer insultin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
growled Hank, ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Giraffe, airily, who made sure to
have his own gun ready in his hands at the time he
spoke in such boasting tones, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t scare so
easy, Mister Hank Dodge, if that&rsquo;s your name.
Fact is, the boys of the Silver Fox Patrol have
helped gather in a few men even more dangerous
than you and your pal ever dared to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, Giraffe,&rdquo; ordered Thad, who knew it
was unwise to add to the anger of the ruffians.
&ldquo;Now, we don&rsquo;t mean to bother you at all, Hank
Dodge. Our business up here has nothing to do
with timber cruisers; and we&rsquo;re not hired by the
Government to watch for any steels of lumber, or
land frauds. We came here to camp out, and to
hunt. And just now we&rsquo;re busy looking up the
comrade who has lost himself in these big woods.
Do you understand what I say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon as how ye put it plain enuff, younker,&rdquo;
replied the other, wondering if Thad noticed that he
was gradually lowering his arms; but the very next
words uttered by the boy told him this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em up high again, Hank! I don&rsquo;t want
to have to shoot you through the shoulder or the
legs, but I will, if you try to grab up that rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a string of hard words the man elevated
his hands once more; but if black looks could kill,
Thad must have expired on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen,&rdquo; said the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go forward, and recover your gun,&rdquo; the other
went on, severely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you letting it
get out of your hands at all. A wide-awake scout
should be smarter than that. And Step Hen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure you don&rsquo;t for even a second get between
the muzzle of my gun and our friend Hank,
there; because I&rsquo;m going to shoot the very second
he makes the first move looking to grabbing either
you, or the gun. Hear that, Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do, Thad, and I&rsquo;ll be careful, just as you
say,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>The boy crept up on one side, and lying down flat
on his chest, reached out an arm, thus starting to
draw his own highly-prized little repeater toward
him.</p>
<p>Hank could see it going, and ground his teeth in
helpless rage, for he could also watch the determined
gleam in those convincing eyes of Thad
Brewster, and only too well did he know what sort
of hard luck would be apt to overtake him, if he
but allowed himself to be tempted too far.</p>
<p>When Step Hen gripped his little gun once more,
he made haste to draw back the hammer. And thus
a fourth weapon was brought to bear upon the persons
of the two notorious timber thieves.</p>
<p>Hank Dodge laughed.</p>
<p>It was not a mirthful sound at all, but rather
caused a shiver to pass through the forms of those
who heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We throws up ther sponge, me an&rsquo; Pierre, don&rsquo;t
we, ole hoss?&rdquo; said Hank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four against two&mdash;zat ees too mooch odds.
We cave; we gif in; we cry out, enough!&rdquo; exclaimed
the ferret-eyed French Canadian <i>voyageur</i>,
who, they said, had once been the factor at a Hudson
Bay Fur Company&rsquo;s post until he betrayed his
trust, and fled to the States with a bunch of money
belonging to his employers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we want to say good-night then, to both
of you,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; ter forget this, let me tell yer,&rdquo;
replied Hank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why there need be any hard feelings
between us,&rdquo; Thad went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only tit for tat.
You held us up first, and now we&rsquo;ve returned the
favor. And we haven&rsquo;t taken anything from you,
Hank Dodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;held up by a pack o&rsquo; kids; we&rsquo;ll never be
able ter look each other in the face agin till it&rsquo;s
wiped out, sum way,&rdquo; the man went on to say,
angrily.</p>
<p>Thad knew that further argument would be useless.
There was only one thing men of their calibre
could appreciate, and that was force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well,&rdquo; he said, as if carelessly, &ldquo;you can do
just as you please about it. But I want to tell you
this plainly, right on the start. We&rsquo;re all armed,
and can shoot as well as the next one. We&rsquo;re no
tenderfeet, like our chum who is lost. And if in
spite of this plain warning you choose to molest us,
look out you don&rsquo;t get something you won&rsquo;t like.
That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say; but you can put it in
your pipe and smoke it. Back off, fellows, but keep
&rsquo;em both covered, and shoot if they try to grab up
a gun!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>So the four scouts backed out of the hostile camp,
the air of which did not seem to agree with them.
Those avaricious eyes belonging to Hank Dodge
did not create a favorable impression on any of
the young campers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure believe he meant to keep my dandy little
gun,&rdquo; Step Hen was muttering, as, having passed
out of sight of the two timber cruisers, the scouts
walked along in couples, on the alert for any signs
of further trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he expected to do,&rdquo; replied Thad.
&ldquo;And another time we happen on any unknown
men in this part of the country, see to it that you
keep your gun in your own possession, Step Hen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will,&rdquo; replied the other, humbly enough;
&ldquo;I had my lesson, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they&rsquo;re coming after us?&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe; and the very possibility of such a thing
caused Step Hen to utter a little cry of alarm, and
turn in several directions, as though expecting to
discover crouching foes, or see the flash that would
accompany the discharge of a hostile gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>But nothing happened; and presently Allan, who
had been looking back over his shoulder many times,
announced that there was no danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t left the camp up to now,&rdquo; he said,
positively. &ldquo;I can see their figures moving in front
of the fire. It&rsquo;s all right, boys. We can go, and
settle down after a little for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Thad called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, we can make a stop,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little swale at the base of this rocky hill.
If we wanted we could make a small fire, and finish
our supper. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d see it; and besides,
Allan and myself will stand guard up on the ridge
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was carried out, since they had not
wholly satisfied their appetites at the time Allan discovered
the camp-fire which they supposed had been
kindled by the lost tenderfoot, Bumpus.</p>
<p>Afterwards Thad and Allan came in, the fire
having been extinguished, and ate a little. Then
they talked in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel uneasy,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
&ldquo;to think of that poor innocent thing of a Bumpus,
who wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger to hurt even a fly, wanderin&rsquo;
around all alone in these big woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Step Hen, seriously enough, &ldquo;and
with a couple of hard cases like that Hank Dodge
and Pierre Laporte around. What if he was unlucky
enough to run across &rsquo;em? wouldn&rsquo;t they just
take revenge on our poor fat chum. I hope that
don&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was not saying anything, but it struck him
that the fellow who could show enough ingenuity
to get himself out of a quicksand, or a muck bed,
the way Bumpus had done, might be far from the
ignoramus some of his comrades still chose to believe
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting sleepy, and I move we turn in,&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe after more time had elapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hold on then, because we&rsquo;ve got to make
a move out of this basin,&rdquo; said the shrewd patrol
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a good enough place to bunk in,&rdquo; grumbled
the sleepy Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dangerous at that,&rdquo; Thad remarked.
&ldquo;Those men may have glimpsed our fire, and give
us a call. We&rsquo;ll not be at home to them. I&rsquo;ve been
told that a hunted man never sleeps where he eats.
Come along; it won&rsquo;t be far, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>After a short walk, Thad announced that in his
opinion, as well as that of Allan, it was now safe
for them to lie down, and get what sleep they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Bumpus is as well off, and got plenty to
eat still,&rdquo; were the last words Giraffe spoke; &ldquo;I remember
the time we got twisted in our bearings up
in Maine, and nary a match between us, with a cold
night at hand. But I got fire all right with my little
apparatus. Besides, there was two of us, and it
don&rsquo;t seem near so lonely when you&rsquo;ve got company
along, even if it is only a tenderfoot scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon all of them had made themselves as comfortable
as possible. The absence of blankets was
going to be severely felt. Without a camp-fire to
cheer them, Thad feared they would be shivering
before morning, even if it was the good old summer
time. The atmosphere close to the foothills of
the great Rockies is quite rarefied, and the nights
are apt to seem even cold.</p>
<p>The four scouts were pretty tired, and they not
only went to sleep quickly, but they slumbered
heavily&mdash;it might have been hours for all any one
of them could say, when they were suddenly awakened
by a series of heavy crashes and detonations
that sounded very much as though an earthquake
had shaken the Rockies to their foundation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE MEAN TRICK OF THE TIMBER CRUISERS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A land-slide!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, as he sat
up, and began twisting his long neck around, as
though doubtful whether he should dodge to the
right or to the left, since it was difficult to locate the
direction from whence the furious racket seemed to
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better say an earthquake!&rdquo; Step Hen managed
to articulate, though he was shaking all over, with
the excitement, that he would hardly have recognized
his own voice. &ldquo;I c&rsquo;n feel the old ground
shake! Listen, would you, to that smash! Must
be volcanoes around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, and listen,&rdquo; said Thad, in that tone
of authority which both the talkers recognized as
belonging to the scoutmaster, rather than their
Chum Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>So they held their tongues, and strained their
ears to listen.</p>
<p>There was no trouble in hearing, for the racket
still kept up. There were heavy thuds, crashes,
and a breaking of bushes. No wonder the scouts
were mystified. No wonder one thought it a land-slide,
while another believed some supposed extinct
volcano had burst into action again, and that the
rain of stones that followed, produced these weird
sounds.</p>
<p>All at once the racket stopped, just as suddenly
as though a command had been given to &ldquo;cease
firing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, if that ain&rsquo;t funny, now,&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen, but because of the order for
silence which Thad had issued, he dared not
breathe a word above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Surely that sounded like a hoarse laugh. The
boys crouched there, and strained their ears to
hear more. Once or twice they thought they caught
vague sounds. It was as if some one might be
moving along the rocky elevation that formed one
side of the near-by little basin in which they had
made their small fire, and finished their once interrupted
supper. But the sounds were moving further
away, as though the unknown parties might
be retreating.</p>
<p>Then silence, deep and profound, brooded over
the immediate vicinity of the spot where the four
startled scouts sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we talk now, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but let it be in a low voice,&rdquo; replied the
patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen, just as
though he had to let the pent-up steam escape, one
way or another, and it took the form of this expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; asked Step Hen,
plainly confused, and unable to clearly grasp the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; remarked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell us, please,&rdquo; quickly asked Giraffe.
&ldquo;Sounded like a laugh to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was, too,&rdquo; Thad went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who&rsquo;d want to act funny when all that
racket was going on, Thad?&rdquo; continued Giraffe,
who seemed unusually thick headed just then, possibly
on account of being aroused in such a startling
manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The men who made all the row,&rdquo; replied the
scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men who made the row&mdash;great governor! d&rsquo;ye
mean these rowdies, Hank and Pierre?&rdquo; burst out
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other,&rdquo; said Thad, positively. &ldquo;They must
have located our little fire in some way, and supposed
that we were sleeping close by. So they crept
up along the side of that bare ridge, where the
stones are so thick, and just started to heave a few
dozen down. That&rsquo;s why it sounded like thunder
and hail combined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo; hissed Giraffe, whose honest
blood seemed to almost boil with indignation; &ldquo;the
sneaks! Afraid to face four boys because they
believed we could shoot some, they had to crawl
around to the back door, and play a trick that you&rsquo;d
think would be about the size of the meanest boy
in our home town of Cranford, Brose Griffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They laughed over it, too,&rdquo; burst out Step Hen,
almost as angry as his long-legged chum, &ldquo;and
that shows what kind of fellows they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether, it was a lucky escape for us,&rdquo; remarked
Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; added Giraffe. &ldquo;And we owe
a heap to Thad&rsquo;s long head. Never sleep where
you eat&mdash;that was a pretty good rule for the old
hunter to have, when painted Injuns were all
around him. And by George! it seems to be all
right, even in these modern days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! just think what a time we&rsquo;d a had,&rdquo;
observed Step Hen, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;d been sleepin&rsquo; there
just as sweetly as&mdash;as the babes in the woods, and
all of a sudden them rocks began to smash around
us. I can just see the whole blessed outfit scrambling
in the dark, trying to get behind trees, and
yet not knowing which side of the trunk was the
safe side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen actually chuckled a little, as though a
gleam of humor had begun to light up the serious
nature of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a game just in keeping with such a
precious pair of rascals,&rdquo; declared Thad. &ldquo;They
might have injured some of us badly; and that
was just what they hoped to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps killed us in the bargain,&rdquo; Allan added.
&ldquo;Some of the rocks they heaved into that little
basin were just fierce. They came down like cannon
balls. It was like what Rip Van Winkle heard,
when the little old men of the Catskills were playing
ten pins with big rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Thad,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, &ldquo;when they get
to thinking it over, don&rsquo;t you reckon now they&rsquo;ll
guess they didn&rsquo;t do any damage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what was in my mind,&rdquo; replied the leader
of the patrol. &ldquo;They must know that even men
would have yelled, and shown all sorts of excitement,
when bombarded in that way. But let &rsquo;em
think what they please. I hope we&rsquo;ll never cross
their trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the wish,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I differ with you,&rdquo; declared the
aroused Giraffe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to pay the cowards
back for that dirty trick; and I will, too, if the
chance ever comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only bothering about one thing,&rdquo; observed
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Thad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they run across our innocent chum,
poor old Bumpus?&rdquo; Step Hen went on to say,
&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s so confiding, and so straight himself,
that he couldn&rsquo;t believe wrong of anybody. Why,
they&rsquo;d rob him of his gun, and everything else he
had; and then turn him loose like that, in the big
timber. Oh! I hope they just don&rsquo;t find Bumpus
before we get to him. It would be a shame!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like taking candy from the baby,&rdquo; added
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go to sleep again! We can talk
it over in the morning,&rdquo; suggested Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe I c&rsquo;n sleep another wink,&rdquo; declared
Step Hen.</p>
<p>But in spite of his gloomy prophecy, he did drop
off again soon after stretching himself out on the
ground, in the softest spot he could find; and knew
nothing more until some one shook him. Looking
up, Step Hen discovered that the dawn was stealing
through the timber, and that Thad bent over
him.</p>
<p>The other two were already astir. Giraffe was
busying himself, as usual, in getting a little fire
underway; for Thad had given it as his opinion
that after playing such a dastardly mean trick,
Hank and Pierre, the lawless timber cruisers
would not feel like venturing over in this quarter
again, lest they be greeted with a warm fire from
the guns of the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>All of the scouts felt more or less chilled, as the
early morning air was pretty cool, and consequently
the fire proved acceptable.</p>
<p>As they munched their breakfast Thad announced
that he had found the trail of Bumpus
again. This meant that when they were ready to
start out, there would be little delay.</p>
<p>Of course, pretty much all the talk was about
the event of the preceding night, and the fortunes
of their lost comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I shut my eyes,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;I c&rsquo;n
just see that blessed innocent awalkin&rsquo; through these
here woods, awhistlin&rsquo; for his bear to come out and
be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen,
&ldquo;whether Bumpus, if he does run across a cinnamon
bear, just through the luck greenhorns seem
to have, would climb his tree <i>first</i>, and then begin
shooting; or just bang away, like he did before, and
make for a tree afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I guess Bumpus learned his little lesson
that time, all right,&rdquo; declared Giraffe, with the
superior air of one who had already gotten <i>his</i>
bear, and could afford to look down on those not
so fortunate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was scared, good and hard,&rdquo; Step Hen
went on. &ldquo;Why, his face looked like pie paste,
and his goggle eyes fairly stood out of his head
when he couldn&rsquo;t get up in that tree, with the old
grizzly a comin&rsquo; for him, growlin&rsquo;, and champin&rsquo;
his teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad only smiled as he heard these remarks that
had an undercurrent vein of condescending pity
for the tenderfoot chum. If he remembered correctly,
Bumpus was not the only frightened scout
about the time that wounded grizzly charged the
camp. He had plenty of company.</p>
<p>When they had finished eating, the fire was put
out; and after that they made for the spot where
Thad had found the trail of the lost scout.</p>
<p>It was as plain as day just there, even though
some twenty-four hours must have elapsed since
the fat and ambitious Nimrod passed that way.</p>
<p>Giraffe and Step Hen were suspicious of the two
rascally timber cruisers, and persisted in keeping
their eyes constantly on the alert, searching every
possible spot for an ambuscade, and holding their
guns ready for quick work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The patrol leader did not attempt to interfere, although
he and Allan were of the opinion that the
men would not bother trying to look them up. It
gave the boys more or less practice, and did no
harm.</p>
<p>And so the little bunch of scouts started to once
more lift the trail of their missing chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE BOB-CAT.</span></h2>
<p>The morning was half gone, and they had been
making pretty fair progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Giraffe, when Allan mentioned this
fact, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re only holding our own, that means
we&rsquo;ll never glimpse the poor old chap in a week,
&rsquo;less he just drops down from being so worn out,
reduced to skin and bones, so to speak,&rdquo; and both
he and Step Hen chuckled at the possibility of
Bumpus ever coming to such an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always
a chance that you might sight him somewhere.
You see, he turns every which way. Now
he&rsquo;s heading almost north; and a little while back
it was nearly due east. Perhaps he may double on
his tracks yet; we can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he did, and happened to discover all our
footprints, what d&rsquo;ye think the blessed innocent
would do?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be scared stiff, most likely, and think Injuns
must be trailing him, bound to take his scalp,&rdquo;
laughed Step Hen.</p>
<p>Thad stopped for a minute&rsquo;s breathing spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think both of you are wrong there,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;and if Bumpus did only happen to come
on his own trail, after we&rsquo;d passed along, the
chances are he&rsquo;d just make up his mind to sit down,
and wait for us to come around again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the wide world would Bumpus ever
guess it was <i>us</i> made the tracks?&rdquo; Giraffe demanded,
incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have to guess, because he&rsquo;d
know!&rdquo; Thad ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must believe that fat chum of ours is waking
up, Thad? Just tell us, will you now, how he&rsquo;d
be so dead sure of this? We haven&rsquo;t been dropping
our visiting cards along the way, that I saw,&rdquo;
and Step Hen gave Giraffe a sly wink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have, right along,&rdquo; Thad continued,
&ldquo;and unless I&rsquo;m much mistaken, Bumpus can read
the signs all right. He knows what kind of an imprint
your shoes make, Step Hen, and how there&rsquo;s
a bunch of nails shaped like a star in both of your
heels. Look down there, and you&rsquo;ll notice them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered if there ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; muttered
the surprised Step Hen, as if the fact was quite
new to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Giraffe, he also knows that you &lsquo;toe in&rsquo;
with your right foot, so that each time you step
it makes a little peculiar scrape. Bend down and
I&rsquo;ll show you, here, and here, and here. Catch on
to it, now, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never knew that before; but it&rsquo;s a fact,
Thad, I do turn that foot some, I admit. Tried
to break off the habit lots of times, but it&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;look at my track,
and you&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s a marked peculiarity that
makes it different from any other. I had a piece
put on each heel, and the line shows as plain as
anything. And now here&rsquo;s Allan&rsquo;s footprint&mdash;do
you see anything about that you&rsquo;d be likely to recognize
if you ran across it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we do,&rdquo; burst out Giraffe. &ldquo;The shoe is
square at the toes, broader than any other. Besides
that, Allan walks with his feet nearly straight, and
most people turn them out some; all but those
that toe-in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, now, that each one of us has an
individual mark,&rdquo; continued the patrol leader, wishing
to impress the lesson on the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all right, Thad; but how would a
tenderfoot like Bumpus know all about these
things?&rdquo; persisted Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do <i>you</i> know?&rdquo; demanded the leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! because you just told us, I guess,&rdquo; the
tall scout admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just the case with Bumpus,&rdquo; went
on Thad. &ldquo;Of late he&rsquo;s taken a remarkably deep
interest in the thousand-and-one things that are
open to the eyes of a scout, if only he chooses to
look around. And so, when he asked about following
a trail, I showed him how to tell the marks
of every scout in the patrol, himself included. And
Bumpus wrote them all down in that little notebook
he carries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that don&rsquo;t beat all creation!&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just imagine the poor boy squattin&rsquo; down, to
pull out his note-book, and then say: &lsquo;There, I
know Giraffe made those tracks; and that other
must be the manly tread of my good friend, Step
Hen Bingham!&rsquo; I guess it&rsquo;s up to us to improve
each shining hour, ourselves, Giraffe, like the busy
little bee. We don&rsquo;t want a tenderfoot like Bumpus
to beat us out, do we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<p>And for three minutes the two of them were
busily engaged writing descriptions in their scout&rsquo;s
note-book, with which every one in the patrol was
provided; stopping now and then to examine or
measure one of the tracks.</p>
<p>When this operation was concluded, much to the
amusement of Thad and Allan, the forward movement
was again resumed.</p>
<p>But it seemed as though this little incident must
have aroused the curiosity and ambition of Giraffe
and Step Hen, for they frequently asked questions
that had more or less bearing on trailing.</p>
<p>And the information which Allan was able to
give, in addition to what the scoutmaster said, quite
enthused both searchers after facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I never thought there was so much in this
trackin&rsquo; business,&rdquo; Step Hen honestly admitted.
&ldquo;I used to believe it was pretty much of a fake,
and that fellers just kind of went along, smellin&rsquo;
out things, like a setter or a hound would. But now
I see it&rsquo;s a whole lot of fun; and I&rsquo;m going in for
trackin&rsquo;. I am to be a champion trailer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out there, fellers!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe.</p>
<p>They saw him swing his gun around, and almost
immediately discharge the heavy rifle. All of the
others hastened to get their guns in a serviceable
condition, even while they were looking to see what
had happened to excite the tall scout.</p>
<p>Something flashed from one tree to another, and
vanished amidst the dense growth of leaves. As
this tree was close to others, the chances were that
the animal would have little difficulty in eluding
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! a big wildcat!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen,
in great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, did you see his left hind leg drag <i>just
a little</i>, when he landed on that limb?&rdquo; asked Giraffe,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you aimed to take him on the left hind
leg, did you?&rdquo; jeered Step Hen, advancing a pace
in the hope of discovering the beast crouching
above, and offering a fair target.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t time to aim, but just shot any old
way,&rdquo; declared the other. &ldquo;Fact is, I don&rsquo;t believe
the butt of my gun was more&rsquo;n half way to my
shoulder when I let go. He was agoin&rsquo; to jump
right then, and I knew it was hit or miss with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dangerous thing to do when it&rsquo;s a lynx or a
bob-cat,&rdquo; remarked Allan, who, being a Maine boy,
had had lots of experience with the fierce beasts.
&ldquo;Better have let him get clean away. But I don&rsquo;t
think you wounded him, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I never knew a wildcat that was
wounded to run away,&rdquo; Allan replied. &ldquo;Once you
give them pain, and you can make up your mind
you&rsquo;ve got a fight on your hands, and the chances
are, a warm one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tried for him, anyway,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can glimpse his old staring yellow
eyes somewhere up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they failed to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make up your minds he&rsquo;s got clean off before
now,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;The way one of those big cats
can spring from tree to tree is fierce. But we
haven&rsquo;t the time just now to be looking for cats. I
don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve lost any, do you, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that old rascal seemed to be hanging on
a limb just about over where our tenderfoot pard
must have passed by,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe, a new fear
arising in his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my, I hope now he wasn&rsquo;t there when
Bumpus came along,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, as if
comprehending the thought that had taken form in
the mind of his comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this mean, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allen, just
then, pointing down close to his feet; and the
other three uttered various exclamations when
they saw what he was referring to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spots of dried blood!&rdquo; gasped Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, now, for a fact,&rdquo; Step Hen followed with,
&ldquo;Oh! that cat must have jumped on poor old
Bumpus, and clawed him up something scandalous.
He bled like a stuck pig, as he ran off. And
see here, where something&rsquo;s been just dragging
along the ground. What if he&rsquo;s wounded so bad
he had to pull one leg after him? This is just
awful, fellers. Poor old Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>But Thad and Allan somehow did not seem to
join with the others in feeling sorry. At least
they made no remarks. And as they all walked
slowly on, following the blood-stained tracks, if
Giraffe or Step Hen, instead of keeping their eyes
so closely upon the ground, had ventured to raise
them a little, so as to take in the faces of their
chums, doubtless their surprise would have been
great to notice that Thad wore a broad smile, while
Allan was making various suggestive gestures, and
winking one eye in the direction of the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>So they walked slowly forward a score or more
of paces, when Giraffe and Step Hen were once
more startled. This time it was not by the sudden
appearance of a ferocious wild beast, but only the
voice of Allan calling out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look! look! whatever can that be, hanging
yonder from the limb of that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">BUMPUS&rsquo; STOCK ABOVE PAR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Same old cat again!&rdquo; burst out Giraffe; and
he was in the act of raising his gun, to his shoulder
this time, when Thad caught hold of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Giraffe!&rdquo; cried the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it <i>is</i> a cat!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, rubbing
his eyes with the knuckles of one hand, and
looking again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Step Hen had cautiously advanced a
pace or two, staring at the dangling object as
though he did not know whether to really believe
his eyes or not.</p>
<p>Giraffe, seeing him going on, pushed to his side;
and when the two of them came close to the object
that had gripped their attention, they turned to
exchange stares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dead cat!&rdquo; said Giraffe, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hung up by the hind legs to that limb;
now who could have done that?&rdquo; demanded Step
Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been the same old critter that
tackled our poor chum, Bumpus, back yonder.
Some friendly forest ranger just happened along
in the nick of time, and used his rifle on the yowler.
Here&rsquo;s where the bullet hit him, right in the heart,&rdquo;
and Giraffe laid his finger on the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say, here&rsquo;s where another caught him on
the square head, and this hole shows where yet
a third passed through his body. Why, he&rsquo;s been
riddled, all shot to pieces, that&rsquo;s plain!&rdquo; Step Hen
declared, positively; and the other two listened,
not wanting to break in just yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buckshot, not a rifle bullet ended this here
cat, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say, Bumpus is carrying a two-shot Marlin
scatter gun that uses buckshot cartridges!&rdquo; went
on Step Hen.</p>
<p>They looked at each other again, and then once
more eyed the swinging trophy of <i>some one&rsquo;s</i> skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s silly to think of <i>him</i> knockin&rsquo; over a
ferocious animal like this here cat,&rdquo; Giraffe ventured
to say. &ldquo;I never saw a bigger one; and he
must have looked fierce enough, I tell you, when
he was alive, and could arch up his back, and just
growl in a way to make your blood run cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! s&rsquo;pose you take a squint up to where the
legs are tied to the limb of that tree, Giraffe?&rdquo;
suggested Step Hen, chuckling now with a new
sense of humor.</p>
<p>The tall scout craned his long neck, the better
to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter! say, that does look like it, now,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, sure enough,&rdquo; avowed Step
Hen, &ldquo;a piece cut from that rope Bumpus carries.
You can see it&rsquo;s braided sash cord, and I&rsquo;d know
that old rope among a thousand. He done it, all
right, Bumpus did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe whistled, to indicate the extent of his
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever think he had it in him?&rdquo; he observed,
scratching his head as he stood there, and
gazed at the dangling wildcat. &ldquo;I reckon, now,
he must a had the best luck ever, when he just shut
his eyes and pulled trigger. This old cat must a
wanted to commit suicide. P&rsquo;raps he just climbed
up and looked into the muzzle of Bumpus&rsquo; gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know better&rsquo;n that, Giraffe. He must have
been some distance away, or else the buckshot
wouldn&rsquo;t have scattered as much as it did. I
reckon, now, our fat chum is improving a heap.
That was a great shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Step Hen,&rdquo; Thad broke in to
say. &ldquo;And take another look at the cat, will you?
Tell me if you see anything strange about him?
I imagine the one Giraffe chased away was a mate
to this, and must have been smelling at the body
still, when we came up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen uttered a little cry, and then remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, would you believe it, the old thing was
a cripple. You can see he only had three paws.
The aft fore paw is gone. Like as not it was bitten
off in some fight he had long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo; cried Giraffe, who had leaned
forward to examine the injury at closer quarters.
&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t any old hurt. The blood is as fresh
as any of the rest, and I guess it only happened
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Go on,&rdquo; declared Thad, and the tall
scout, spurred on by that word of commendation,
to exert himself to the utmost, was quick to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that the paw wasn&rsquo;t bitten off, nor
yet shot away,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The cut is as clean
as a whistle, and I reckon only a sharp hunting
knife would do the job like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would Bumpus want to go and hack
a paw off the old cat for?&rdquo; objected Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for a trophy, silly,&rdquo; answered the&rsquo; other,
quickly. &ldquo;He just didn&rsquo;t know how to skin the
beast, and hardly liked the job of toting it all
around with him. So you see, to convince the rest
of us that he&rsquo;d really and truly knocked over a
wildcat, he just took that paw along. How&rsquo;s that,
Mr. Scoutmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You hit the nail on the head that time, Giraffe,&rdquo;
answered Thad, pleased at the way the other
had figured things out, for it proved that, once
aroused to do his best, the tall scout possessed the
ability required for reading &ldquo;signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was one of the things that Thad Brewster,
as acting head of the troop, always tried to impress
upon the minds of the scouts under him.
&ldquo;Let every tub stand on its own bottom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Learn
to depend on yourself; do your own thinking; keep
on the watch, and see all the wonderful things that
are constantly happening around you in the great
storehouse of Nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be awake, active&rdquo;&mdash;in a
word, as the manual of the organization has it, &ldquo;be
prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe and Step Hen had been tremendously
staggered by the knowledge that the stout comrade,
whom they always looked down on as a weakling,
and called their &ldquo;tenderfoot pard&rdquo; with such a
tone of patronage, seemed to be actually waking
up, and doing things.</p>
<p>It was not enough that he exhibit the nerve to
want to go out in search of a bear, all by himself.
There was that episode of the muck bed for example&mdash;that
sent Bumpus&rsquo; stock up a few points above
par. It revealed the fact that in an emergency the
fat boy could actually <i>think for himself</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of allowing himself to get &ldquo;rattled&rdquo;
after discovering that he was gripped fast in the
tenacious mud, Bumpus had looked around him,
and noticed that convenient limb above his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Of course he had stretched out his hands toward
it, but vainly, as they must have fallen short
by two feet or more of reaching the limb. And
then Bumpus remembered the fine rope he was
carrying around his fat waist, under the conviction
that it might come in handy some time or other.</p>
<p>Well, it did. Bumpus had drawn himself out of
the mud, and up to the friendly limb of the tree;
though it surely must have proven a most severe
tax on his untrained muscles, he was such a heavy
weight.</p>
<p>Giraffe admitted, deep down in his mind, that he
could not have done any better himself.</p>
<p>And now, here was this same blundering, awkward
Bumpus, actually knocking over a monstrous
wildcat, one of the most ferocious animals roaming
through the swamps adjoining the big timber
belt.</p>
<p>It was commencing to dawn upon the minds of
those two boys that, beginning right now, they
would have to revise their opinion of Bumpus. He
hardly seemed a fit candidate for the greenhorn
grade of scout. Really, there seemed to be some
class to this work he was putting up, that promised
to raise him high up in the estimation of his
comrades.</p>
<p>In fact, both of the boys who stood there, examining
the hanging bob-cat, were beginning to
wonder what next Bumpus would do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be another feller,&rdquo; remarked Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; replied Giraffe. &ldquo;I never
would have believed he had it in him. Biggest surprise
ever. Gosh! Step Hen, after this, d&rsquo;ye
know, it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to make me expect
bigger things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if he keeps on going at this warm pace,
Bumpus might even get his old bear yet, who
knows,&rdquo; Giraffe asserted.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan noticed with considerable amusement
and satisfaction that the boys no longer alluded
to the lost comrade as &ldquo;poor old Bumpus,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;our tenderfoot pard.&rdquo; Their pity for the
clumsy scout was fast changing into sincere admiration,
respect. And surely Bumpus deserved
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good lesson all around, eh Thad?&rdquo; whispered
Allan in the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is,&rdquo; was the scoutmaster&rsquo;s reply
in the same low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus is learning to depend on himself,&rdquo; Allan
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these boys have been taught to be more
careful how they allow themselves to feel so superior
to a comrade who happens to be slower about
waking up. They won&rsquo;t forget this in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, boys, let&rsquo;s be going on,&rdquo; Thad remarked,
aloud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly like the looks of the sky
over yonder where the breeze is coming out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words of the scoutmaster caused Giraffe
and Step Hen to turn and look back of them. So
much engaged had they been in keeping tabs on
the trail, and scanning the woods on either side
for a possible glimpse of Bumpus, that neither of
them had once bothered about looking at the
heavens.</p>
<p>Hence a great surprise awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! did you ever see blacker clouds?&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe, apparently deeply impressed by
what he had discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we might be in for a big storm,&rdquo;
remarked Step Hen uneasily, for he never felt as
brave as he might when the elements were battling
with one another; but in order to disguise his timidity
he added: &ldquo;but then, as we ain&rsquo;t sugar or salt,
I guess we won&rsquo;t melt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they hurried along through the timber, still
following the plain trail left by the lost scout, it
might have been noticed that Allan and Thad really
looked more serious than the other pair. And
there was a good reason for it, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">THE SWOOP OF THE STORM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Whoo! she&rsquo;s coming right along, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen volunteered this statement, when the
first rumble of thunder was borne to their ears
from the direction whence the storm was advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that,&rdquo; added Giraffe, and then he went
on: &ldquo;I say, Thad, don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better let
up on this trail business, and hunt for a place
where we might sit out the storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just come to that conclusion myself,&rdquo; replied
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And seems to me we hadn&rsquo;t ought to lose any
too much valuable time in doing that,&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen, starting a little when there came a flash
of lightning, and later on another deep growl of
thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still three miles away; I counted between the
flash and the thunder,&rdquo; announced Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! three miles ain&rsquo;t a song when the old
wind gets to blowing,&rdquo; declared Step Hen. &ldquo;Notice
that it&rsquo;s died out altogether now, fellers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And getting pretty dark, too,&rdquo; Giraffe added.
&ldquo;Looks to me like we might be in for a little
cyclone. Wonder if they ever have &rsquo;em up here,
like they do in Kansas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyclone!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen, &ldquo;oh! my
stars! and here we are without even a cyclone cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and find one,&rdquo; said Thad, encouragingly,
for he had been keeping his eyes around
him a long time back, noting the formation of
the ground, and drawing his own conclusions.</p>
<p>They were no longer walking steadily on. Thad
had increased his pace to a run, and his comrades
kept at his side, as though determined not to be
left in the lurch.</p>
<p>The sounds from the rear had gradually increased
in volume. The thunder was louder, and
more ominous, as each dazzling flash of lightning
made the timber around them stand out most distinctly;
although after it had passed, the semi-gloom
seemed more appalling than ever.</p>
<p>And that other threatening sound, could it be
the wind playing havoc with the tall trees? Thad
had from time to time noticed that they came upon
a windrow of fallen timber, all the trees lying in
one direction. This circumstance had told him
once that in a great while the region at the foot of
the Rockies was visited by a destructive storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Might not this one prove to be such, and throw
down more of these giants of the woods?</p>
<p>Thad had to bear this in mind, along with many
other things. Surely, if the storm proved to be
so severe that trees were going to be uprooted and
blown down, they wanted to be out of danger.</p>
<p>Step Hen was getting more and more excited.</p>
<p>He always felt this way, even at home, when the
air was charged with electricity. Many a time he
could remember walking up and down a room,
like a tiger in its cage, while the elements were
holding high carnival without.</p>
<p>And while he believed that the scoutmaster
would do all that lay in his power to get himself
and comrades into some sort of shelter before the
threatening storm broke over their heads, Step
Hen saw no reason why he should not assist, as
far as he could.</p>
<p>So he kept those sharp eyes of his on the constant
watch, as he ran along at the side of the pace-maker.</p>
<p>Suddenly Step Hen gave a triumphant shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look! look! here&rsquo;s a good place for us to
crawl in,&rdquo; and he pointed to one side as he spoke.</p>
<p>There, as another bright flash lighted up the
gloomy forest, Thad saw an enormous tree, easily
the king of them all. Doubtless it out topped all
its comrades, rearing its lofty head far above the
best of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>And yet old age had started in to demolish the
monarch of the woods, beginning at the butt instead
of the top. The giant tree was hollow.
There yawned an aperture, surely large enough to
hold the four scouts easily, if they chose to huddle
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the hole is pretty well away from the
track of the storm, so the rain ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to beat
in on us,&rdquo; Step Hen went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we crawl in, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, showing
by his manner that he was only too willing to
comply, if the scoutmaster said the word.</p>
<p>But Thad and Allan exchanged a look, and each
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tree for mine in a storm like this, come on
boys;&rdquo; called out the patrol leader, once more
starting on a run.</p>
<p>Step Hen hesitated. It even seemed as though
the spirit of finding safety was tempting him to
hold back. If he thought Giraffe would back him
up, Step Hen might possibly have declined to leave
the big hollow tree that looked so inviting to him.</p>
<p>But Giraffe, either more submissive to authority
just then, or else not quite so frightened by the
crash of the approaching storm, was already hurrying
after the leader.</p>
<p>And so Step Hen went on, although grumblingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we use that nice, old hiding-place,
Thad?&rdquo; he called out; for the thunder, together
with the roar of the wind, and the rain, in their
rear, made so much racket, that talking in ordinary
tones was impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tree might go down with a crash in the
gale,&rdquo; was what Thad said over his shoulder, as
he ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;raps that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And worse than that, it was liable to be struck
by lightning,&rdquo; added the young scoutmaster.
&ldquo;Nearly always picks out the tallest tree, or one
standing alone. You never want to get under a
tree in a thunderstorm, remember that, Step Hen.
Better lie down flat on the ground, and take your
soaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even though the advice was shouted at him
under such peculiar conditions, Step Hen was apt
to remember it. Indeed, those very conditions
served to impress it indelibly on his mind. He
would never again hear the crash of thunder, and
see the vivid flash of lightning without remembering
what Thad had said.</p>
<p>And every boy should do the same; for what
does a wetting amount to, beside the peril of sudden
death? Every day during the summer there
can be found brief accounts of men or boys killed
by lightning, because they took refuge under a tree,
when a storm interrupted their work in the harvest
field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>During an ordinary shower a tree may be an
acceptable shelter, but never when the air is sur-charged
with electricity; since it serves as a conductor
to draw the lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we agoin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Giraffe who broke out with this appeal,
shortly after they left the neighborhood of the
hollow tree that had so tempted Step Hen.</p>
<p>Up to this point the tall scout had been blindly
following Thad&rsquo;s lead. The quality of obedience
was plainly well developed in Giraffe. But now
his curiosity seemed to get the better of these other
traits in his character. Although he did not come
from Missouri, and in fact had never seen the
sacred soil of that grand state, still Giraffe
&ldquo;wanted to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did Thad seem to take it amiss in a comrade
asking such a natural question, under the circumstances.</p>
<p>He was always willing to volunteer information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got an idea we ought to find some ledges on
the other side of this little rocky knob hill on the
left,&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>That was the extent of his remarks, and for
several reasons. In the first place he had considerable
confidence in Thad&rsquo;s sagacity, for he had
seen it successfully tried under many conditions;
and what the other suggested appealed to Step Hen
as reasonable. Then again, he was short of breath,
and needed all he possessed in order to keep running
along with the others.</p>
<p>Step Hen and Giraffe kept pretty well up in the
van. Now and then, when a particularly fearful
flash came they would turn part way around, as if
the fascination of that on-coming tempest were too
much for them.</p>
<p>And sometimes either one would give utterance
to an excited whoop when the timber was lighted
up by an unusually dazzling flash, though the cry
was sure to be immediately deadened by the reverberating
thunder.</p>
<p>They also noticed with some degree of satisfaction,
that they were even then rounding the low
rocky elevation. Unless Thad had made a sad mistake
in his judgment, they should know the facts
before another minute passed.</p>
<p>But so rapidly was the storm coming along now,
that apparently they would have none too generous
an allowance of time.</p>
<p>With the rush of the wind another sound began
to be heard that was quite disconcerting. This was
a frequent crash, such as even Giraffe and Step
Hen knew must accompany the fall of trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>They were glad on this account, if for no other,
that Thad had led them by degrees out of the big
timber, so that they now skirted the base of the
singular little rocky elevation that was almost devoid
of trees.</p>
<p>The thought of being in constant danger of having
one of those giants topple over upon their
heads, was far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Between the flashes it had become oppressively
dark, so much so that the boys had to be more
careful where they set their feet. But with all that
turmoil of shrieking winds, crash of falling trees,
and roar of thunder, chasing along in their rear,
and rapidly overtaking them, it was little wonder
that at times they made mistakes in where they
stepped.</p>
<p>And presently, what Thad had been fearing
came to pass, when Step Hen shouted out at the
top of his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up, Thad, Giraffe&rsquo;s taken a tumble; and
I reckon he&rsquo;s some hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BOLT OF LIGHTNING.</span></h2>
<p>In the midst of such a confusion of dreadful
sounds, and knowing that in another minute or so
they would be overtaken by the storm, it was little
wonder that Thad&rsquo;s heart seemed to feel a cold
clutch when Step Hen burst out with that announcement.</p>
<p>What if Giraffe had broken a leg in taking this
tumble? He was that tall, and possessed such
&ldquo;spindle legs,&rdquo; as the boys always called them, that
they often joked him on the probability of his
cracking a bone when he slid to second base.</p>
<p>And it was in dreadful fear, then, that the scoutmaster
halted, to turn hastily around.</p>
<p>To his satisfaction he saw that Giraffe, helped
by Step Hen, was already scrambling to his feet,
although limping some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Giraffe?&rdquo; called out Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On deck; go ahead!&rdquo; came the cheery reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>And shutting his teeth hard together, Giraffe
managed to once more start on a run after his
chief, though his bruised leg must have hurt him
considerably.</p>
<p>They were now turning the side of the rocky elevation.
And just as Thad had said, it seemed to be
made up of little ledges, one above the other. This
was not a mere guess on Thad&rsquo;s part, for he had
noticed the same peculiar formation in connection
with several other outcroppings they had passed,
these being off-shoots of the foothills at the base
of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>And so, again did that policy of observation,
&ldquo;noticing things&rdquo; promise to prove of great assistance
to the fugitive scouts when chased by the
storm. It often does, and the boy who keeps his
eyes about him under any and all circumstances, is
the one who reaps the profit. There is never an
emergency arises but he is ready with some remedy
to meet it.</p>
<p>When they saw these friendly ledges the other
boys realized that for the time being their troubles
were about at an end.</p>
<p>There would be plenty of chances for them to
find shelter here. Thad did not accept of the very
first refuge that offered, because he knew there
was still a little more time at their disposal, and
he had an idea they would presently come upon a
ledge capable of covering them all.</p>
<p>It turned out just as he figured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>When the four crept under the outcropping shelf
of rock, they found that they had no longer any
need to fear the violence of the gale.</p>
<p>The lightning could not well reach them here, the
wind was powerless to do them any harm; there
were no threatening trees to topple over upon their
heads; and as for the rain, it would sweep past, and
leave them perfectly dry.</p>
<p>No wonder then, that Step Hen, in the sudden
change of his feelings from dark despair to complete
satisfaction, gave vent to a scout whoop;
while Giraffe, equally pleased, uttered several fox
barks, that being the distinguishing signal of the
patrol, by which members would recognize each
other if approaching in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something like!&rdquo; cried Step Hen, in between
the thunder claps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As comfy as if we were at home,&rdquo; added Giraffe,
who was sitting there, gingerly rubbing his
bruised shin.</p>
<p>A tremendous crash made further talk just then
out of the question. And it seemed as though that
thunder clap might have been the signal that the
stage was all set, and the war of the elements could
begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The wind started in with a furious rush that
snapped off several trees not far away from where
the four scouts huddled under their shelter. These
came crashing down, as though loudly protesting
against their untimely fate. But the sound of their
fall was really swallowed up in all the other mad
noises that marked the first rush of the summer
storm.</p>
<p>How the wind did whistle through the tops of
the trees, that bent before its fury, together with
the downpour of rain. The ones that could prove
most humble, and bow their proud heads, best,
were those that came out of the turmoil with the
least damage. The trees could adapt themselves to
circumstances, the scouts saw; and surely there
was another lesson for them all in that.</p>
<p>After a furious rush, the storm slackened up a
little, as though gathering force for a fresh outburst,
perhaps more strenuous than before.</p>
<p>But this little breathing spell afforded the boys
a chance to exchange a few remarks, since it is at
all times a difficult task to keep their tongues from
wagging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a swift one, all right!&rdquo; Giraffe burst
out with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear such thunder?&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lightning&mdash;oh! my stars! it just made
me blink, and shiver every time it flashed,&rdquo; declared
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the worst is yet to come!&rdquo; announced
Thad, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s joking,&rdquo; cried out Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; the scoutmaster went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always noticed that when a storm lets up like this,
it generally hits harder the next spell. And you&rsquo;ll
find out, if you wait a minute, for it&rsquo;s coming
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re all right here, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;unless it turns
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turns around!&rdquo; ejaculated Step Hen. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
mean to say that old wind could take a kink in
itself, and come back on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It often happens during a storm. In the beginning
it may beat down on you from the east,
and finish up in the southwest. But I guess the
second half of this one is coming out of the same
quarter as the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for that!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all so cozy under here, I&rsquo;d hate to have the
wind drive that wet rain in on us. There she comes,
boys. Whew! say, listen to that, would you? I
hope that thunder don&rsquo;t start the rocks to rolling
down this slope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that,&rdquo; called out Thad, for with
the return of the furious bombardment talking was
becoming more difficult.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Just as the scout leader had said it, it really did
look as though this second half of the storm promised
to be more violent than the one that had gone
booming along its way. It seemed to the boys that
some of the thunder claps would split their ear
drums, so powerful did they appear.</p>
<p>The rain again fell in torrents, too. They could
hear it rushing furiously down the side of the little
rocky hill. Several spouts shot over the outcropping
ledge that served as their roof; but despite
it all, none of them so much as had a sprinkle fall
upon him.</p>
<p>Never had the wisdom and sagacity of the scoutmaster
been more amply proven than right then.
And doubtless each of the other three boys must
have been secretly saying as much, as they crouched
there, gazing in speechless wonder and awe at the
curious freaks shown by the zigzag forked lightning,
every time it came down from the black vault
above, or played tag among the piled up masses of
clouds that were slowly retreating.</p>
<p>Apparently the worst was over.</p>
<p>Even then doubtless there was a break in the
van of the storm clouds. Furious though the
tempest had been, it was to prove of short duration.
But while it lasted Thad reckoned that it
was about as tropical in its nature as any he had
ever encountered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad it&rsquo;s going!&rdquo; called out Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never will be missed,&rdquo; sang Step Hen, feeling
particularly joyous over the fact that after all
they had come through it all unscathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The rain&rsquo;s stopped, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; Giraffe asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means the danger&rsquo;s over. We can
go out now, when we please,&rdquo; Step Hen remarked,
making a movement as if to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that yet,&rdquo; exclaimed
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, but at the same
time falling back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of dangerous electricity in the
air still,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;You can see that the reports
after each flash are as quick and powerful as
if a twelve-inch gun on a battleship were being
fired. Every bolt strikes just after a storm has
passed. Lots of people say the back action is the
most dangerous time of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right, Thad. Guess I&rsquo;ll stay awhile
longer. No need of a feller takin&rsquo; more chances
than he has to,&rdquo; and Step Hen settled down again;
for if there was any danger of being struck by
lightning, no one would find him careless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the end, ain&rsquo;t it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe,
still rubbing at his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it is,&rdquo; replied the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how our fellers in camp stood the
racket. Hope the tents didn&rsquo;t get blown away,&rdquo;
Step Hen remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Bumpus, I reckon he&rsquo;ll be put to his wit&rsquo;s
ends to know what to do at such a time as this,&rdquo;
but Thad noticed that when he said it, Giraffe
really betrayed an undercurrent of respect in his
manner.</p>
<p>Bumpus was no longer a complete ignoramus;
Bumpus had raised himself wonderfully in the
estimation of his chums.</p>
<p>Just then there was an unusually brilliant flash.
The thunder seemed to really accompany it, showing
that the bolt struck near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! that hit something, as sure as you
live!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I heard branches crashing down, and
I reckon it must have been a tree,&rdquo; remarked Step
Hen, who had given a nervous jump at the brilliant
and dazzling illumination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>did</i> shatter a tree, and over in the very place
we came from, too. To tell you the truth, fellows,
it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit if it was that same
big tree that had so splendid a hollow in its butt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen turned very white when he heard Thad
say this, and a painful silence fell upon the little
group of scouts under the friendly ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">STEP HEN LOOKS OUT FOR THE PROVISIONS.</span></h2>
<p>Some little time passed. Gradually the storm
was passing away in the distance, where they could
still hear the constant growl and mutter of the
thunder. But those near-by crashes had really
ceased.</p>
<p>As the boys were cramped, and becoming restless,
Thad saw no reason why they should not get
out in the open again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I want to look at that leg of yours,
Giraffe,&rdquo; said the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw! guess I&rsquo;ll manage all right,&rdquo; replied the
other, his pride revolting at such a thing as showing
the white feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it ought to be looked after,&rdquo; persisted
Thad. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to take any
chances of your being lamed. A stiff leg is a constant
bother. And there&rsquo;s no need of it when I&rsquo;ve
got liniment and salve and linen in my haversack,
for just such uses. Here, roll up the leg of your
trousers and let Doc Thad take a look. No nonsense,
now, Giraffe. It&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>So, protesting still that it &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t amount to a
row of pins,&rdquo; Giraffe nevertheless obeyed the injunction
of the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, it is quite an ugly wound, and bleeding
too,&rdquo; declared Thad. &ldquo;And you might have had
a heap of trouble with that same hurt, Giraffe, if
you didn&rsquo;t let me put some salve on. It&rsquo;s an open
cut and the liniment would bite too much. Besides
this healing salve is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Thad soon had a nice bandage fastened
snugly about the hurt. Giraffe frankly admitted
that it did feel soothed by the application, though
he still had to limp more or less when he walked,
naturally favoring the lame leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can go ahead again, and find old
Bumpus,&rdquo; Step Hen remarked, after the operation
had been successfully finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it all,&rdquo; said Allan, with a
disconsolate shrug of his shoulders, and making a
wry face at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worst of what?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we going to pick up the trail at the place
we lost it, or back where the old cat hangs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any trail!&rdquo; Allan replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; ejaculated both Step Hen and Giraffe,
amazed by his declaration, that filled them with
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain washed it all out, you see,&rdquo; Allan
went on to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;how are we agoin&rsquo; to find Bumpus,
then?&rdquo; Step Hen gasped.</p>
<p>Again the Maine boy shrugged his shoulders,
and there was something very expressive about the
movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me something easy, please? I confess I&rsquo;m
all up in the air. I don&rsquo;t know how we can find our
chum, unless by an accident, later on, we came
upon his fresh trail again, made after the storm.
And that&rsquo;s supposing a good many things, you see,
one of which is that he&rsquo;s come out of the racket
safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! strikes me we&rsquo;ve got as much chance
of running across him as we&rsquo;d have finding a needle
in a haystack,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about as much,&rdquo; Allan replied, looking
downcast.</p>
<p>As long as there was any trail to find, Allan was
not the one to give up; he would hang on tenaciously
while a shred of hope remained. But with
the tracks of Bumpus positively washed out by
the downpour from the clouds, it was useless wasting
time in looking for any &ldquo;signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Thad seemed serious now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Troubles were accumulating thick and fast, for
the missing member of the Silver Fox Patrol.
Though thus far Bumpus seemed to have surmounted
his trials and difficulties, he might have
been caught unawares by that furious storm. And
what if he had been tempted to seek shelter in a
hollow tree, not having a wise scoutmaster handy,
to warn against the evil of such a thing? Giraffe
and Step Hen felt very uneasy at even the thought.</p>
<p>They left the vicinity of the ledges, and once
more entered the tall timber. But the others knew
that Thad was indulging in no hope that they could
discover any signs of the trail, or follow it, even
though an occasional footprint remained. He had
some other purpose in leading them backward, and
they could hazard a pretty good guess as to what
it might be.</p>
<p>There were abundant signs of the storm&rsquo;s passage
all around them. Some of the more slender
trees still bowed their heads in the direction where,
far away in the distance, the thunder still growled
and muttered. Here and there the boys could
see one that had been uprooted, and either thrown
flat to the ground, or else received in the sheltering
embrace of some neighbor, that held it in a half
reclining attitude.</p>
<p>And presently Giraffe gave vent to a loud cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>did</i> strike Step Hen&rsquo;s tree!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it? I don&rsquo;t see the same;&rdquo; demanded
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look again. Rub your eyes, and wake up!
Don&rsquo;t you glimpse that pile of branches over there,
scattered in every direction?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do,&rdquo; admitted the other, &ldquo;but how
d&rsquo;ye know now that wreckage came from my
tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; replied Giraffe. &ldquo;Notice
that shattered trunk partly standing yet? Well,
step this way and you can see where part, only part,
mind you, Step Hen, is left of that hiding-place you
wanted to crawl in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my stars!&rdquo; ejaculated the other scout,
when his staring eyes told him that what his comrade
said was the awful truth.</p>
<p>It had been the luckiest escape those four boys
would ever know. They felt a great awe steal over
them, accompanied by a sensation of thanksgiving,
as they stood there looking at the ruin of that once
proud king of the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us would ever know what hit us, I
guess,&rdquo; said Step Hen, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I reckon I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson all right,&rdquo;
added the tall scout. &ldquo;Just as Thad said, what&rsquo;s
a ducking, when you think of taking chances with
a thing like this? I am for a wetting down, every
time, after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what had we better do&mdash;head back for
camp, and give our poor old chum Bumpus up for
good?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; the scoutmaster replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some grub still,&rdquo; suggested Giraffe,
&ldquo;and can make fires all right, no matter how wet
the wood got.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can stay out for another day or two,&rdquo;
said Thad, &ldquo;and longer than that, if we think
there&rsquo;s any chance of finding him; because we could
knock over some game at the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the programme?&rdquo; persisted Giraffe.
&ldquo;Are we going to lay out some sort of
plan, and then follow it up; or just go meanderin&rsquo;
around, every-which-way, trusting to sheer luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and figure on what Bumpus was most
likely to do,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;and then pattern our
plan after that. And later on, you know, we could
give a shout once in a while. If he was near
enough to us he might hear us that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Thad, and it&rsquo;s a good scheme,&rdquo;
declared Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dandy one,&rdquo; added Step Hen. &ldquo;And if ever
Bumpus hears me ashoutin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll know who &rsquo;tis, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, yes,&rdquo; Giraffe observed, with such
a meaning look that the other took umbrage at
once, and flamed out with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t any more like the caw of a crow than
your squawk is, Giraffe, and you know it, even if
you used to say so. That&rsquo;s because you was envious
because, outside of Bumpus himself, I could
sing better&rsquo;n any other scout in the whole troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe made no answer to this taunt. He only
looked appealing toward Thad, as much as to say
that he was not to blame for this flare-up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>They walked on for a while, although the going
was not so very pleasant, owing to the fact that
the bushes were all so wet, they had to avoid contact
with them.</p>
<p>Allan and Thad conferred as they went, and apparently
must have laid out their plans, for the
others presently became aware of the fact that they
seemed to be moving ahead in something like a direct
line.</p>
<p>Although they had thus far met with no great
success, Step Hen and Giraffe still felt considerable
confidence in their leaders. Thad and Allan seemed
so able to cope with anything and everything that
came along, it was no wonder the others had begun
to believe they could accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>But when the afternoon waned, and another
night stared them in the face, they had to temporarily
forget about Bumpus, and consider their
own condition.</p>
<p>A fire would certainly be needed, for everything
around them was still wet; and as the droppings
from the trees had partly soaked their garments,
Thad thought they must dry out.</p>
<p>But a piece of luck came their way about this
time that was as welcome as it was unexpected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Step Hen happened to be out on the left flank,
and suddenly the others heard the report of his
rifle in that quarter. As they hastily turned that
way, it was to see Step Hen dancing madly up and
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it! I got it!&rdquo; he was shouting, clawing
at his little repeating rifle in the endeavor to work
the pump action, and render it serviceable again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got what?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A deer!&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have. Tell us where?&rdquo; asked the
tall scout, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over back of them bushes. It was just going
to jump when I let go. Guess it dropped in its
tracks!&rdquo; panted Step Hen.</p>
<p>Giraffe gave a mocking laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see if you put a flim-flam bullet
into an old stump,&rdquo; he remarked, derisively, limping
forward: and immediately shouting: &ldquo;Well,
of all the world, if he didn&rsquo;t get the nicest little
buck you ever saw; and shot straight through the
heart. No wonder he went down ker-flop. Step
Hen, you&rsquo;re going some. I&rsquo;ll have to look out, or
else you&rsquo;ll be crowding at my heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat that snapshot if you can, Giraffe,&rdquo; said
the other, proudly looking down at his quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE BIG TIMBER AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>That night the boys feasted.</p>
<p>After being without fresh meat for some little
time now, that venison certainly did taste prime.
And no doubt it was doubly sweet to Step Hen,
who had made the best shot of his life when he
brought the game down.</p>
<p>At least they need no longer think of being compelled
to return to the camp near the foot of the
noisy rapids, on account of a lack of food. They
could go a number of days, subsisting on the new
supply that had stocked up their almost exhausted
larder so handsomely.</p>
<p>But there was a weight resting on all of them.
They talked some, but most of the time after supper
they sat there, looking into the comfortable
blaze, and busy with their thoughts.</p>
<p>What these were, as a rule, might be gathered
from a remark made by Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good supper, all right, and that deer
meat went just prime. Only wish <i>he&rsquo;s</i> got as
good to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no one asked him who he meant. No doubt
every one of the four around the fire had Bumpus
in mind right then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to keep this fire burning
through the live-long night, too,&rdquo; said Thad, later
on, when there was some talk of going to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regardless of Hank and Pierre, eh?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe, his eyes brightening; for he never liked to
see a camp-fire go out; it was always as solemn a
ceremony in his mind as the passing of a dear
friend would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! like as not they&rsquo;re miles and miles away
from here,&rdquo; Thad went on to say. &ldquo;And anyhow,
one of us at a time will be on guard all night. If
he hears a shot or a distant shout be sure to call
me up, whoever he may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that, then, was the programme laid down.
They would do everything in their power to attract
the attention of the wandering Bumpus, in
case he happened to be anywhere in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But it was all of no avail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Doubtless one or the other of the scouts, when
standing his turn as sentry, may have fancied he
heard far-away hails, because the wish was father
to the thought; but upon listening, to make doubly
sure before arousing the others, it had invariably
turned out that the sound was an owl calling to his
mate in the depth of the big timber, or the strange
cry of the night hawk abroad seeking food.</p>
<p>But all the live-long night that watch-fire continued
to burn, although without any result.</p>
<p>The boys went about their duties in the morning,
a little crestfallen; and yet they had no reason
to reproach themselves, having done everything in
their power to win success.</p>
<p>As they ate breakfast they tried to lay out the
day&rsquo;s campaign. Enough of the fresh venison was
to be carried along to provide several meals. And
as they went, they meant to let out a few shouts at
intervals.</p>
<p>Of course they knew that, just as one of them,
Giraffe, had said before, it was about as satisfactory
as searching for a needle in a haystack.
But it was the best they could do. And boys as
a rule, are very prone to put considerable confidence
in what they call &ldquo;luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the violent storm there was one good result,
at least; the air was as sweet and pure and
invigorating as any of them could wish. Indeed,
Thad, as he glanced around and above him, when
they stopped once that morning to rest, thought
he had never seen a lovelier picture. And only
for this weight resting so heavily upon his soul, in
connection with the fate of the missing tenderfoot,
he could have enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The sky was the bluest of the blue, with here and
there a fleecy white cloud floating across it. Away
up could be seen a pair of eagles sailing in immense
circles, and able to look directly into the face of
the sun.</p>
<p>Lower down a number of other large birds were
floating around, and it looked as though they might
be centering over a certain spot. Thad recognized
them as buzzards, those scavengers of the wilds
that are protected by law in most sections of the
country, because of their usefulness in disposing
of carrion that might otherwise breed an epidemic
of disease.</p>
<p>On one side glimpses could occasionally be had
of the lofty mountains, to explore which had been
one of the excuses the scouts had for making such
a long journey.</p>
<p>Apparently the other boys were also looking
around them, for presently Step Hen, pointing with
his finger, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those birds away up there, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ones up in the clouds, you mean, I suppose?&rdquo;
asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the majestic eagle, my son,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
pompously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Majestic humbug,&rdquo; laughed Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they represent the American nation,&rdquo; objected
Giraffe, &ldquo;every time the papers get talkin&rsquo;
about trouble with foreign nations they say &lsquo;now
listen to the eagle scream&rsquo; don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it can scream, all right, and fight right
hard, I admit, when it has to,&rdquo; Allan went on to
say, &ldquo;but all this talk about the eagle being such
a <i>noble</i> bird makes me weary. If you&rsquo;d watched
him as often as I have, sitting lazily on the limb
of a dead tree, and waiting till some poor, industrious
fish hawk makes a haul, so he could rob
him, you wouldn&rsquo;t have quite so much respect for
the magnificent bird as you do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! p&rsquo;raps not,&rdquo; grunted Giraffe, looking
crestfallen. &ldquo;Honest to goodness now, I always
did think the old feller couldn&rsquo;t live up to his reputation.
Guess America had ought to hunt up another
emblem besides the eagle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say, them others ain&rsquo;t eagles, I know,&rdquo;
spoke up Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are the despised buzzard, that everybody
shuns, yet no one kills, for he&rsquo;d be far worse
to eat than crow,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet a ten times more useful bird than the
eagle, which lives upon its ill-gotten reputation, and
as I said before, the labor of the osprey, or fish hawk,&rdquo;
Allan went on to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see &rsquo;em circle around, would you, Thad,&rdquo;
Step Hen kept on. &ldquo;They generally do that, don&rsquo;t
they, when they&rsquo;ve discovered something worth
while?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Step Hen did not wholly voice the terrible fear
that had suddenly gripped his heart in a sickening
clutch. There was no need, for every one of the
other scouts had a spasm along the same lines.</p>
<p>They looked at each other rather guiltily. An
undefined fear was written large upon each paling
countenance. Thad, however, was the first to recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me an uneasy minute with the suggestion
your words conjured up, Step Hen,&rdquo; he
said, firmly; &ldquo;but I just can&rsquo;t force myself to believe
there&rsquo;s anything to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hold on, Step Hen,&rdquo; the patrol leader went
on to remark, &ldquo;I understand what you mean, and
of course we&rsquo;ll head that way, to make sure it&rsquo;s a
deer, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of them cared to pursue the matter any
further, as they walked along, keeping one eye
aloft to note the position of the buzzards that sailed
around and around, constantly dropping lower, and
with the other taking stock of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Thad smiled after a while, but he did not take
the trouble to communicate what was in his mind
to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know soon enough,&rdquo; he was saying to
himself, &ldquo;let them find it out for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Allan was the first to make a discovery. He
threw a quick, knowing look in the direction of the
scoutmaster, who answered with a nod and a
smile.</p>
<p>Pretty soon Giraffe began to smell a rat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;seems like
I&rsquo;ve set eyes before on that there queer old tree
with the big hump on its trunk. Can&rsquo;t be possible
there could be another just like that anywhere this
side the Rockies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one saying anything, Giraffe went on to remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, it&rsquo;s the same identical tree, I&rsquo;d take my
affidavy on that. See here&rsquo;s where I sliced off a
bit of the bark with my hatchet, as we went along.
Now, ain&rsquo;t that funny, we&rsquo;ve made a grand circle
ourselves, just like we thought he&rsquo;d <i>do</i>; and
crossed our own trail right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea where this tree is, Giraffe?&rdquo;
asked Thad, meaning to test the memory
of the observing scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, when was it I noticed the same?&rdquo;
and Giraffe frowned with the effort to whip his
memory. &ldquo;Oh! yes, sure, I recollect it all now.
Why, you see Thad, it was just after we&rsquo;d left
that place where Bumpus had hung up that dead
cat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! there it hangs right now; and yes, as
sure as you live, the wind brings us a whiff of it,
too!&rdquo; cried Step Hen. &ldquo;Say, Thad, was <i>this</i> what
the buzzards scented far off, and gathered here
to make their dinner off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was, and they&rsquo;re welcome, for
all of me,&rdquo; replied the patrol leader; evidently
greatly relieved over something. &ldquo;But come on,
boys, we&rsquo;re going to start on a new track from here,
one we haven&rsquo;t been over yet. I&rsquo;m in hopes we
may have the great good luck to learn something
about our chum, before we make another grand
circuit. My first guess didn&rsquo;t pan out very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of them were sorry to leave the neighborhood
of the dead cat, which Bumpus had hung up
in the tree, possibly in the hope of sometime claiming
its well-riddled pelt.</p>
<p>An hour later they were making their way
through a particularly bad stretch of woodland,
where the brush was dense in places, and many
trees, fallen years upon years ago, forced the scouts
to either clamber over, or go around.</p>
<p>Step Hen was just in the act of jumping over
the half-rotten trunk of one of these fallen forest
monarchs, when the rest heard him give utterance
to a loud whoop, immediately followed by words
that struck a chill to their very hearts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad! Allan! come here, quick! I&rsquo;m snake
bit, and I reckon it was a big rattler that grabbed
me by the leg!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE SNAKE BITE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do, Thad?&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe,
as with the others he hurried over in the direction
of Step Hen&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Step Hen had not kept exactly with his mates;
had he done so the trouble that was now upon him
might not have happened. Encouraged by his success
of the preceding day, when he had secured a
fine deer just because he hung upon the flank of
the advancing party, Step Hen had wandered far
afield again, though careful, after a fashion, never
to lose sight of the rest.</p>
<p>It was easy to understand, under the circumstances,
how the ambitious Nimrod kept his eyes
about him, looking for a possible deer to jump up
and bound away. He had not been thinking of
snakes at all, when so recklessly jumping over the
dead tree; and this is always a more or less dangerous
thing to do in a country where poisonous snakes
may be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>They came upon the frightened Step Hen. He
was down on one knee, and with hands that trembled
so he could hardly work, was trying to roll
up one of his trousers&rsquo; legs, after having kicked off
his canvas legging.</p>
<p>Thad was instantly at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do that for you, Step Hen,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as he dropped his gun, and applied himself
to the task, to cry out a few seconds later,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any marks where his fangs went in.
Where was it he struck you? Oh! that red spot?
Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad, to the astonishment of the injured lad,
whipped out a small magnifying glass, with which
he was in the habit of examining beetles, and all
sorts of things of a like nature, in whose habits he,
as an amateur naturalist, chanced to be interested.</p>
<p>This he applied to the red mark, examining the
same closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see two sets of little punctures, one above
and one below,&rdquo; he announced presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen. &ldquo;Oh! he
jumped right at me, and bit me, all right! I was
that scared I could hardly move. I hate snakes,
you know, the worst kind. Thad, tell me, did anybody
ever get bit by a rattler, and live? My goodness!
will you have to cut my leg off, to save me?
Oh! I think I&rsquo;d rather die right now, than have to
hop around on one leg all my life. Do something
for me, Thad; what are you grinning at, Giraffe?
This is a mighty serious matter, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; said Thad, sternly.</p>
<p>Then he got down, and sucked at the tiny wounds
with all his might, having first made sure that
he had no cut, or abrasion of the skin about his
lips, or the interior of his mouth. Having expectorated
freely Thad got up again. Step Hen
followed his every movement with a troubled look
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you got all the old poison out, Thad?
Oh! let somebody else have a try, won&rsquo;t you?
Can&rsquo;t afford to take any chances about this. Think
what an awful blow it&rsquo;d be to my folks if I skipped
off right here and now. Ketch me a jumpin&rsquo; over
a log again without first lookin&rsquo;. Where&rsquo;s my
gun? Did anybody see my gun? Goodness knows
where it went. I bet that snake went and carried&mdash;oh!
thank you, Allan, there&rsquo;s the little dandy, all
right. But Thad, don&rsquo;t it look like my leg&rsquo;s beginning
to swell? I just seem to feel it twitching
all the time. Is that the poison going through my
system? Oh! I just knew some day a measly old
snake&rsquo;d get me. How I hate &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; commanded the scoutmaster,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right, Thad. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do the
right thing by me; but it&rsquo;s just awful to know
you&rsquo;ve been bitten by a rattlesnake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I don&rsquo;t believe it <i>was</i> a rattlesnake!&rdquo;
said Thad, positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was an <i>awful</i> big, wicked looking snake,
Thad; and if you&rsquo;d seen the way it jumped at
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I had for saying
what I did,&rdquo; Thad went on, &ldquo;a rattlesnake never
attacks any one, or any enemy. It always throws
itself into a coil, and with head erect, and tail rattling
a warning &lsquo;don&rsquo;t tread on me,&rsquo; waits to be
attacked. This rule has no exception. A rattlesnake
is almost helpless out of coil, and the very
first thing he does is to curl up. He may lunge so
hard at something as to throw himself half way
out of coil; but as quick as a flash he&rsquo;s back again,
for he&rsquo;s afraid something will get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is that so, Thad?&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen,
still keeping one anxious eye on his bare leg, as
though he half expected to see it begin to puff up
visibly before his very eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this snake coiled when you first saw it?&rdquo;
demanded Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it doing then, Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it was crawlin&rsquo; along&mdash;yes, I know it
was, because I remember how I got a fierce jolt
when I was just going over the log, to see it with
its old head raised, and showing its teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it jumped at you?&rdquo; Thad continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And tried to wrap around me, after it bit me
through my legging; but I guess I kicked some,
because it dropped off, and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure now it was not a rattler,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;No doubt it may have been a big black snake.
They&rsquo;re as fierce as they make them, and can whip
a sluggish rattler every time, but they&rsquo;re not poisonous
at all, Step Hen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope then it was a black snake!&rdquo; exclaimed
the other scout, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; said Thad, wishing to make it
conclusive, so Step Hen might not keep on worrying
about the affair. &ldquo;A black snake bites, but as
a general rule a rattlesnake opens his jaws until
they stand almost perpendicular, so that he can
lay bare his poison fangs. He sinks these two hollow
teeth into his enemy, with a furious blow, and
at the same time injects the poison. There is no
known <i>sure</i> remedy for a rattlesnake&rsquo;s poison. But
this snake tried to bite you. There are the faint
marks of teeth belonging to both the upper and
the lower jaw. It&rsquo;s all right, Step Hen; you&rsquo;re in
no danger. The poison would have begun to work
before now, if it was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t take any chances, will you,
Thad?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I sucked just as hard as if I thought
you were going to swell up, and have your heart
affected,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to make sure, Thad, suppose you paint my
leg with some of that purple stuff you carry with
you,&rdquo; pleaded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you mean that solution of permanganate of
potash,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Thad, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s meant for scratches
from the claws of carnivorous animals, so as to
neutralize the virus that is apt to get in the blood,
and give blood poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s some poison it can get in its little
work on,&rdquo; Step Hen insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will hurt like sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her hurt. The more the better; because
then I know it&rsquo;ll be doing its work. Come, let&rsquo;s
have it, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing how persistent Step Hen could be when
he wanted to, the scoutmaster felt that he must
comply with his request. It could do no harm, and
at least would make the boy feel easier in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! don&rsquo;t it darken things up some,&rdquo; Step
Hen declared, a little later, when the application
had been made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stains a whole lot,&rdquo; admitted Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;ve got one thing to be thankful for anyhow,&rdquo;
Step Hen remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;em, my boy,&rdquo; laughed Thad. &ldquo;But
what do you mean in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he pinched me on the leg,&rdquo; the other
went on, whimsically. &ldquo;Think if he&rsquo;d jumped up
and dented my nose, and you had to paint it like
that! My stars! mebbe I wouldn&rsquo;t be a sight
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d sure never a been able to go back to
Cranford,&rdquo; declared Giraffe, who had been an interested
observer of all that went on. &ldquo;Because
they&rsquo;d all say you&rsquo;d taken to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! nothing funny about that, because I&rsquo;ve
been drinking all my life,&rdquo; the other answered
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess, yes,&rdquo; replied Step Hen, making
a grimace; &ldquo;but then, I want it to just gouge me.
Go it, you little gripper; hope you counteract every
drop of poison. That&rsquo;s it, hit me up again.
Whew! that&rsquo;s going some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there are two of us,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
as he vied with Step Hen in seeing which could
limp the most. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your right leg, and my left
one; so we&rsquo;ve still got a decent pair between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they ain&rsquo;t mates, by a long shot,&rdquo; declared
Step Hen.</p>
<p>Joking in this way they followed after Thad and
Allan. But as the morning was nearly done it was
decided to make camp long enough to have a bite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Again they talked of Bumpus and his affairs, as
they sat around the fire, and ate.</p>
<p>Step Hen hoped that the fat scout would not
have the misfortune to run across a &ldquo;fighting
snake,&rdquo; such as the one that had thrown him into
such a panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;not knowing
any better, the poor feller would think it was a
rattler, instead of just a plain, every day black
snake. And it w&rsquo;d give him no end of worry, because
he couldn&rsquo;t suck the wound himself, being no
contortionist like Davy Jones; and he wouldn&rsquo;t
have Thad and his little potash bottle handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, &ldquo;there are
some people who don&rsquo;t know the difference between
a poisonous rattler, with its square head, and a
long twisting black snake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen turned a little red in the face, and
laughed; but did not venture to take up Giraffe&rsquo;s
dare, so that for once an argument that might have
waxed fierce was avoided.</p>
<p>Presently they were moving on again. Acting
on the suggestion of Thad the four scouts had
formed a sort of fan formation, being within easy
seeing and hearing distance of each other, but covering
quite a wide stretch of ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Allan and Thad had given it as their opinion, although
they admitted they could not be absolutely
sure, that although they must certainly have covered
fully thirty miles in their wanderings, they
were not more than ten from the camp by the
rapids.</p>
<p>It fell to Giraffe to make a discovery this time.
Along about two o&rsquo;clock he raised his voice and
gave an excited call. This being the signal to assemble,
the other scouts hurried toward Giraffe,
anxious to learn what he had to communicate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">MORE TROUBLE AHEAD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What have you?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, who,
strange to say, in spite of his lame leg, arrived just
a little in advance of the other two.</p>
<p>Giraffe was standing there, twisting that long
neck of his this way and that. He declined to say
anything until Thad had arrived on the scene.
Then, with an expressive pose, he pointed to the
ground near his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye call that, eh? Tell me I ain&rsquo;t got
the eye of an eagle? Somebody else might have
gone stumping along, and never seen it. But you
can ketch a weasel asleep as easy as you can fool
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trail, all right,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say <i>his</i> trail,&rdquo; persisted Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus did make it, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; Allan
broke in with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>after</i> the storm, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No question about that, because the rain hasn&rsquo;t
washed the marks at all,&rdquo; was the joyous declaration
of Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; cried Giraffe.</p>
<p>If he had been wearing a vest. Step Hen really
believed the proud lengthy scout would have
thrust his thumbs into the arm holes and assumed
a pose, as though about to have his picture taken
as a serious rival to Cooper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leatherstocking,&rdquo;
the greatest of trail finders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; Step Hen broke out with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck nothing,&rdquo; flashed back Giraffe, refusing
to be cheated out of any of his honors. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
reward of patient, plodding work, and using eyes
and brain right along. Now, if I&rsquo;d been satisfied
to limp along, looking up at the sky, and all around,
but never once on the ground, like some people I
know do, d&rsquo;ye suppose I&rsquo;d ever run across this
trail? Not much. Give Old Eagle Eye his due,
Step Hen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he deserves it,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;because this
is a most important find. It places us on top once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because now we&rsquo;ve got something to work on,&rdquo;
added Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this track made this morning?&rdquo; asked
Step Hen.</p>
<p>Allan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; continued the other
scout, bound to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can see that the ground was still
quite wet when he passed along here. That
wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case this morning, for in
twelve hours or more it must have dried out pretty
well,&rdquo; Allan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; I never thought of such an easy explanation,&rdquo;
Step Hen admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s a heap of things about this business
we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Giraffe; &ldquo;but it all
sounds so mighty interesting I&rsquo;m bound to learn
right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were following the new trail while exchanging
remarks along this line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good thing about it,&rdquo; Thad went on to
say, &ldquo;we now know Bumpus must have come
through the storm all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However did he do it?&rdquo; murmured Giraffe,
perplexed because the tenderfoot was proving such
a wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three to one he found a hollow tree and
crawled in,&rdquo; grumbled Step Hen. &ldquo;With the
luck he&rsquo;s got, why of course lightning never struck
there; while with me it was just sure to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;between you and me
I don&rsquo;t believe Bumpus would do that, because we
were talking of lightning only the other day. He
had an uncle who was killed that way when a tree
was struck; and Bumpus said nobody would ever
get him to take such chances. I remember his asking
me if it would be all right to crawl in a hollow
log that lay flat on the ground, and I told him yes.
So if he was able to find a log big enough to hold
him, I guess that&rsquo;s what he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe gave a whistle. There was a little trace
of envy in his manner, for Giraffe was a boy, and
it did seem to him Bumpus was developing along
the lines of a scout altogether too fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your finish as patrol leader, Thad,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;That Bumpus has just waked up,
and there&rsquo;s no telling what he&rsquo;ll do. I expect we&rsquo;ll
all be kowtowing to him yet, like he was a real
Chinese mandarin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; laughed Thad. &ldquo;And it would
tickle me a lot, I tell you, if a few more scouts
would take a notion to wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Giraffe, &ldquo;they may, yet. I
know two that are digging knuckles into their eyes
right at this minute, and stretchin&rsquo; and yawnin&rsquo;
like they just meant to stir out of their dope sleep;
eh, Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Giraffe! Bumpus has set us the pace,
I tell you,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of the trail, Allan?&rdquo; the
scoutmaster asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About this,&rdquo; replied the tracker. &ldquo;Bumpus was
leg-weary about this time. Plenty to show it.
And I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we came on his
camp before long. I&rsquo;ve seen where he stepped out
of his way, looking for dry wood, and then went
on again, as if not satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Bumpus! He&rsquo;s our pard;&rdquo; exclaimed
Step Hen, glad to even bask in the reflected
light of so much glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, now,&rdquo; Giraffe remarked, his
thoughts naturally turning in the one direction,
&ldquo;was he able to make a fire? Lots of fellers that
like to call themselves scouts wouldn&rsquo;t know how,
when every stick of wood was soaking wet after
such a rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they ain&rsquo;t all such fire cranks as you&rsquo;ve always
been, Giraffe,&rdquo; ventured Step Hen. &ldquo;And I
say it&rsquo;s good for the country they ain&rsquo;t. I reckon
the whole wood supply of the United States would
have been used up by now if the rest of the scouts
had their minds set like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait and see,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
notion that Bumpus is going to surprise some of us
a lot more. Fact is, I believe he&rsquo;s just had his
mind set on a hike like this for some time, because
he&rsquo;s been asking dozens of questions of me, and setting
the answers down in that little note-book of
his, till he half filled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was one of them about makin&rsquo; &lsquo;a fire after a
rain?&rsquo;&rdquo; demanded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; replied Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You told him how to dig out the dry heart
from a stump or a log, to start his fire with, didn&rsquo;t
you, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explained it all fully,&rdquo; answered the patrol
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if that&rsquo;s the case I just guess he will have
made a fire. It&rsquo;s easy, once you&rsquo;ve been shown how,&rdquo;
grumbled Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had to be told how, once, don&rsquo;t forget,
Giraffe,&rdquo; Thad went on to say. &ldquo;Be generous
now, and remember that Bumpus has had his outdoor
education sadly neglected. I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s showing
new life, and I hope it will keep right along. I
believe it will. That&rsquo;s the beauty of this scout business&mdash;once
a boy gets a taste of these many things
that call for self-reliance and thought, he keeps on
wanting to know more. His appetite becomes enormous;
but the food supply in the shape of information
really has no limit, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in for it with all my heart and soul,
Thad,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe, more seriously than the
patrol leader had known him to be for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; echoed Step Hen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing
to know how to save a feller&rsquo;s life if he gets near
drowned, cuts his foot with an axe, gets shot by accident,
or else has the hard luck to run up against
a mean rattler.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you can count on me to help you all I&rsquo;m
able to,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;There are a lot of things I
don&rsquo;t know, myself. Allan, here, is teaching me a
heap about following a trail, and I&rsquo;m enjoying it
more than I can explain. Nothing like the practical
experience, after all. The book-taught scout is
all very well, but he has to change a lot of his ideas
when he comes to see the same things really and
truly done. And some of them are so different
from his notion that he can hardly recognize &rsquo;em.
What is it, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was directed toward the tracker, who
had suddenly shown evidences of excitement. They
saw him bend down and more closely examine the
ground in front.</p>
<p>Then he whistled, and turned a face toward his
chums on which they could plainly read new
anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats anything how they could have just
happened to cross the trail of Bumpus,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>Thad instantly jumped at conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning our old acquaintances. Hank Dodge
and Pierre Laporte?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are their footprints as plain as anything,&rdquo;
continued Allan. &ldquo;Look for yourselves, because
all of you know what they were like. Here&rsquo;s where
Hank rested the butt of his gun on the ground,
while he talked it over with Pierre; and yes, he even
emptied his pipe right at this place, knocking it on
his shoe, because you can see some half-burned
tobacco in this footprint.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they knew who Bumpus was?&rdquo;
asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could guess, easy enough, after remembering
what we said about our having a tenderfoot
chum wandering around here by himself,&rdquo; was the
prompt reply of the trail finder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, it wasn&rsquo;t any of their business,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on to say. &ldquo;They might have had
curiosity enough to figure out who Bumpus was;
but they&rsquo;d never seen him, and so of course he
hadn&rsquo;t done anything to injure them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked troubled, though, even while thus trying
to assure himself that Bumpus could not be in
any peril because of these two ugly timber cruisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his chums had riled them up considerably,&rdquo;
Allan went on, &ldquo;and perhaps they were mean
enough to think they could hit us, through Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen ground his teeth in anger, while his
eyes flashed ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they change their course right here,
Allan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what they did,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And followed after our chum?&rdquo; Step Hen went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself that their prints blot
his out in places,&rdquo; the other replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; said Step Hen, shaking his gun
furiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">STILL IN PURSUIT, WITH THE TRAIL GROWING WARMER.</span></h2>
<p>Step Hen was not alone in feeling angry at this
action on the part of the two unscrupulous timber
cruisers. Every one of the scouts experienced a
degree of indignation that might easily be fanned
into boyish rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t calculate, now,&rdquo; said Giraffe, presently,
&ldquo;that Hank and Pierre are the kind of men
to step out of their way ten feet to do a good deed,
&rsquo;specially toward a boy they&rsquo;d never yet seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t impress me that way,&rdquo; declared
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they haven&rsquo;t much of a reputation for being
tenderhearted, I believe,&rdquo; Allan added, speaking
over his shoulder, for he was following the trail
persistently.</p>
<p>But then, even a novice could have kept on that
trail. None of the three who made it seemed to
think anything about hiding their tracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Those of Bumpus in particular were plainly
marked, and presently Giraffe began to notice this
patent fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be a big difference in these footprints,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly is,&rdquo; Allan replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t mean it that way, because of
course Bumpus hasn&rsquo;t got feet anywhere near as
big as those of Hank and Pierre. But always it&rsquo;s
the same, and his footprints look deeper than
theirs. But for all he&rsquo;s so fat, sure Bumpus can&rsquo;t
be heavier than either of those big broad shouldered
husky men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe seemed to realize that there must be an
explanation which would clear up this little mystery,
and he wanted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what makes the difference, Giraffe,&rdquo;
the tracker went on. &ldquo;You know, we decided that
Bumpus went along here right soon after the storm
yesterday afternoon, and while the ground was still
soft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember, Allan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;Hank and Pierre didn&rsquo;t
happen on the scene until this morning, and by then
the ground was somewhat firm again. Is that plain
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was, and thank you for the explanation,&rdquo;
Giraffe answered. &ldquo;It beats all what
you fellers can get out of this thing. Why, that
alone is about as interesting a fact as anybody
could think up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Bumpus had, say twelve hours the start?&rdquo;
suggested Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here, yes,&rdquo; replied Allan. &ldquo;But you must
remember that he was meaning to settle down for
the night about this time. And when he went on
this morning, perhaps they&rsquo;d be only a couple of
hours behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! things seem to be getting mighty interesting,&rdquo;
remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say they were,&rdquo; Step Hen asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish Davy and Smithy and Bob White
were here.&rdquo; the long scout went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! there&rsquo;s four of us as it is, and all carryin&rsquo;
good guns too. We ought to be enough of a crowd
to hold up that pair of cowards,&rdquo; declared Step
Hen, who did not seem to have a very high opinion
of Hank and his mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did it once, all right,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
with a grin, &ldquo;and we c&rsquo;n do it again, or my name is
Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bumpus hadn&rsquo;t camped yet, had he?&rdquo;
Step Hen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re coming to where he spent last
night,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;I had a glimpse just then of
something that looked like a dead camp-fire. Yes,
here it is, boys, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did do it, all right,&rdquo; muttered Giraffe,
as he stood there, and looked down upon the ashes
of a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thad remarked, &ldquo;and here we can see
where he obtained dry timber by hacking into the
heart of this stump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Bumpus is the surprise of this trip, all
right!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just goin&rsquo; to
take off my hat to him, after what he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to keep us guessing, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Thad
remarked, looking around with a feeling akin to
pride, to realize that the one who all along had been
termed the real tenderfoot of the patrol, should so
suddenly develop such astonishing skill in taking
care of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No babes in the wood about this business, let
me tell you.&rdquo; asserted Giraffe, after he had examined
the way Bumpus had made his fire. &ldquo;Done
things pretty near as well as an old seasoned fire
builder could have made out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a high compliment indeed, coming from
Giraffe. Bumpus must have felt greatly pleased,
could he have heard it. Perhaps his right ear
burned him just about that time, for all boys know
that such a thing happens only when some one is
making complimentary remarks about you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bumpus left here this morning, of course?&rdquo;
said Step Hen; and Allan went on:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did, after passing a pretty comfortable night
on that bed of hemlock boughs which he made, and
which you can see there. Kept his feet toward the
fire, too, just like an old experienced camper, who
was without a tent and blanket would do. And his
going off without this last is what convinces me
Bumpus didn&rsquo;t really mean to lose himself when he
started out to get his bear. He just took a lot of
grub along, his hatchet, and plenty of ammunition,
so as to be pretty well fixed in case he couldn&rsquo;t
make use of his compass in finding the way back to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe placed his hand on the dead ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet &rsquo;em down again, sure he did,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t our chum just <i>it</i> though,&rdquo; chuckled Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept his fire burning all night,&rdquo; Thad remarked,
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye know that?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the amount of ashes tells that he used a
heap of wood,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You can see he
made his camp close to this fallen tree, and used his
little axe in cutting up the dead branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus deserves to be made a first-class scout,&rdquo;
said Giraffe, in genuine enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the road there, anyhow,&rdquo; declared
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must be off,&rdquo; Thad remarked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
had a few minutes&rsquo; rest while figuring out all these
things our chum has been up to. Now let&rsquo;s put our
best leg forward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means the right one,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re away off there; it&rsquo;s the left one,&rdquo;
remonstrated Step Hen, limping more decidedly
with his right leg to prove that it was not &ldquo;in the
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you are correct,&rdquo; declared Thad. &ldquo;It
all depends on the point of view you choose to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course Hank and Company started out
on the new trail, because I can see the marks of
their brogans?&rdquo; ventured Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Allan replied, &ldquo;they looked around the
camp a bit, perhaps surprised to find that even a
tenderfoot scout knows how to take care of himself.
Then they pushed on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far behind Bumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say about three hours,&rdquo; replied the
trail master, without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got that much lead, then?&rdquo; Giraffe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close on it,&rdquo; Allan answered. &ldquo;But something
may cause him to stop, and then they&rsquo;d overtake
him. On the whole, I&rsquo;d rather guess those men
would make faster time than our chum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be slowly but surely gaining, all the
while?&rdquo; suggested Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got to get a hustle on us, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; Giraffe asserted. &ldquo;Already we&rsquo;re away behind
in the race, and just as like as not another
night&rsquo;s going to catch us before we overhaul these
parties. That&rsquo;ll make it bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it any,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
doing our level best, and there&rsquo;s a limit, you know.
We&rsquo;ve just got to leave the rest to Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bumpus&rsquo; luck&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that,&rdquo; said
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure got it along with him this trip,&rdquo;
Giraffe avowed, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s been working over time
for our fat chum too. Seems to me these here gents
are kind of rash tryin&rsquo; to meddle with a feller that
has everything comin&rsquo; to him like Bumpus has.
P&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;ll think they have made a mistake when
they tackle that walkin&rsquo; wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Giraffe and Step Hen chuckled a little, as
though the idea rather appealed to their boyish sense
of humor. And Thad could not help thinking
things had come to a strange pass indeed, when
these two scouts, who had lorded it over Bumpus
so long, on account of their superior knowledge,
were ready to admit that they might yet sit at the
feet of the fat chum, and take lessons in woodcraft.</p>
<p>Would wonders ever cease, Thad thought? But
then, he knew only too well that once a scout becomes
fully enthused with zeal in the pursuit of
knowledge along these lines he will not only open up
new pleasures daily for himself, but surprises for
his friends as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>They had been gone from the camp-fire about
half an hour now. There was no trouble at all
about following the trail; indeed, Allan more than
once declared that even if a bandage were tied over
his eyes he would have been able to keep right along,
using his fingers to guide him, so plainly marked
were the footprints of men and boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Allan, suddenly, &ldquo;I wonder now
what started him to running?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus, you mean, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he began right here. You can see how his
toes press down,&rdquo; Allan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he discovered the men behind him,&rdquo;
suggested Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they were still more than two hours&rsquo; back,&rdquo;
Allan contrived, as he walked on hastily. &ldquo;And besides,
Bumpus never once turned to look behind;
I could tell from his track if he did. Something in
front must have attracted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe and Step Hen looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be just Bumpus&rsquo; luck if he did,&rdquo; the
other boy exclaimed.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke their thoughts aloud further
than that. For a short time they kept moving
rapidly along. And then Allan held up his hand
as a signal for the others to stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it happened, after all these
days of tramping. Bumpus came across the trail
of a bear, and a big fellow too. See here, you can
see his tracks, where none of the others have marred
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER SHOCK.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He was a buster, just as you said, Allan,&rdquo;
Giraffe remarked, uneasily, after they had examined
the imprint of those feet, showing the marks
of the long cruel claws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grizzly, I reckon?&rdquo; Step Hen ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I think he must have been hurt some,
because he seemed to drag his left hind leg a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps Bumpus plugged him,&rdquo; Giraffe suggested,
just as though he were speaking of some
celebrated forest ranger, accustomed to meeting up
with these terrors of the Rockies, rather than a fat
scout who, up to recently, had been looked upon by
most of his comrades as something of a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bumpus was some distance away right
here,&rdquo; Allan continued. &ldquo;There is no sign of blood,
so we know from that the injury was not a fresh
one. And besides, whoever heard of a full-grown
grizzly running away from a dozen human enemies,
after being shot and wounded, much less from a
single foe, and he a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Allan,&rdquo; commented the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon it does look that way,&rdquo; Giraffe admitted.</p>
<p>There was one good trait about the tall scout&mdash;no
matter how strong an opinion he might have on
any subject, once convinced of the error of his
thinking, and Giraffe would own up to his mistake
most cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So right here,&rdquo; Step Hen broke in, &ldquo;Bumpus
was on the run, achasin&rsquo; fast after the limpin&rsquo; grizzly?
Say, Giraffe, he was in your class of cripples,
because Allan says it was his <i>left</i> hind leg that was
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t got but one left leg so that makes
all the difference,&rdquo; the tall scout hastened to announce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; began Step Hen, and then paused,
as though hardly daring to frame his thoughts in
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all doing that,&rdquo; remarked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo; Thad remarked, straining
his eyes to look ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, wouldn&rsquo;t it be just great now,&rdquo; Giraffe
broke out with, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;d just come up with Bumpus
asquattin&rsquo; in the crotch of a tree, all his ammunition
fired away, and that old bear sittin&rsquo; on his
haunches below, awaitin&rsquo; for him to come down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to see it,&rdquo; said Step Hen, making a
suggestive gesture with his gun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to drive a
few dum-dum bullets into his hulking old carcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps Bumpus mightn&rsquo;t be so smart about
getting up in a tree, when a wounded bear was
charging him,&rdquo; Giraffe ventured to remark.</p>
<p>All of them had a painful recollection of that
other episode, when Bumpus, rashly discharged his
ten-bore Marlin at the monster, and would have
been caught trying to climb a tree, only for the help
he received from one of his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bumpus doesn&rsquo;t make the same mistake
twice, I notice,&rdquo; said Thad, firmly; &ldquo;and if he fired
at <i>this</i> bear, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he first of all had a
tree picked out that he could climb, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warrant you he did, Thad,&rdquo; Giraffe added.</p>
<p>They were all of them only too eager to believe
the best. The very thought of Bumpus, after all
the good work he had been doing, meeting such a
dreadful fate as being torn to pieces by a bear, was
something they tried to banish from their minds
as incredible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all this outward display
of confidence, they continued to cast eager glances
ahead as they pushed on.</p>
<p>Giraffe about this time remembered that there
were others also interested in the fate of the lone
scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Hank and Pierre are keepin&rsquo; right
along?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Allan, thinking this was really a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe they think a nice bear skin wouldn&rsquo;t be
a bad article to have, even if it is the off season for
furs,&rdquo; Giraffe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n likely,&rdquo; Step Hen broke in with, &ldquo;they
reckon as how they&rsquo;d better keep along, so as to
bury what&rsquo;s left of our poor chum, and claim his
rifle and other belongings as salvage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope then they&rsquo;ll meet up with the greatest
disappointment of their lives,&rdquo; Thad hastened to
remark, shivering at the cruel picture the words of
Step Hen presented to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all came to a standstill when Giraffe called
out. Every ear was strained in the attempt to catch
a sound that might be a cry for help, or the distant
report of a gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it must a been that old crow cawing himself
hoarse over yonder on that tree,&rdquo; Giraffe finally
admitted. &ldquo;Thought it was somebody callin&rsquo; us to
halt, sure I did, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like you were mistaken,&rdquo; was all the
scoutmaster remarked, as once again the march
was resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps he didn&rsquo;t overtake the old bear after
all,&rdquo; Step Hen broke out with, a couple of minutes
later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was following the trail, all right, when
he got here,&rdquo; Allan asserted, with a positive way
that seemed convincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said at first he saw the bear, when he
took to running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he did,&rdquo; replied the trail hunter, &ldquo;but
since then I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion I was wrong.
Still, you can see that he kept on, for bear, Bumpus
and the two men are written in the tracks as
plain as print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so, Allan. But there don&rsquo;t seem to
be any sign of life ahead. Here, what&rsquo;s the matter
with you, Old Eagle Eye? Just look beyond, and
see if you c&rsquo;n discover our brave chum up a tree
somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus appealed to, and complimented rather than
otherwise by the title which Step Hen had thrust
upon him, Giraffe did stretch his long neck, and
scan the region ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see him a waiving to us, up in one of
those trees?&rdquo; the other asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy,&rdquo; returned the one with the keen vision,
a shade of disappointment perceptible in his voice.
&ldquo;I c&rsquo;n see heaps of trees, and p&rsquo;raps there might be
a boy sittin&rsquo; up in one of the same; but if he&rsquo;s waving
to us, I don&rsquo;t get on to his wave. But hold on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then you <i>do</i> see something?&rdquo; cried Step
Hen, pulling back the hammer of his repeating rifle
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a tree,&rdquo; replied Giraffe, cautiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Something in his manner, perhaps in his paling
face as well, gave Thad a nervous chill. As for
himself, he had not discovered anything amiss;
but perhaps his range of vision was more limited
than that of the tall scout; or possibly he did not
chance to be looking in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where then?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;on the ground,&rdquo; replied the other, slowly
and soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;do you think it&rsquo;s Bumpus?&rdquo; demanded
Step Hen, also losing his color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s a little bush in the way,
and I can&rsquo;t see very well,&rdquo; Giraffe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;does it move any, Giraffe?&rdquo; the horrified
Step Hen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to, one bit, all the time I&rsquo;ve been
keepin&rsquo; my eye on the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen could not command his voice to say
more. He kept staring in a general direction ahead,
as though he could see what attracted the notice of
the chum who had the telescopic eyes.</p>
<p>But Thad was not so easily satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me where you mean, Giraffe,&rdquo; he said,
grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>If there was any unpleasant duty to be performed
Thad Brewster could be depended on to go about
it without flinching. He would have made a fine
soldier, because discipline was so much a part of
his nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, follow those three trees that run as
straight a line as if some surveyor had a planted
the same for range finders. D&rsquo;ye see that light
bunch of scrub just beyond? All right, look just to
the left, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; said Thad, quietly.</p>
<p>A dozen seconds of dreadful suspense followed.
Then Step Hen, who had managed to recover his
lost breath, broke forth with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Bumpus, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; replied the scoutmaster,
steadily, and it could easily be seen that he must
have just been under a terrible strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that; I&rsquo;m asking for information,
but all the same I&rsquo;m awful glad to hear
you make that remark,&rdquo; Giraffe observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the color
of our chum&rsquo;s clothes,&rdquo; Thad began, &ldquo;and then, on
the other hand, it&rsquo;s certainly too big to be him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you hit the nail on the head there, Thad,&rdquo;
Giraffe hastened to declare; &ldquo;now that I look
closer, I reckon it is just too big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;s only a rock after all, or an old
stump,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it is,&rdquo; replied the tall scout, meekly, for
his feelings had been so recently torn by conflicting
hopes and fears, that he was in no mood for argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s push forward and see,&rdquo; suggested Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trail seems to lead that way, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Thad
mentioned, when they had been moving along
swiftly for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll soon know the worst, because,
unless I&rsquo;m much mistaken the <i>thing</i> is lying just at
the other side of them bushes. They&rsquo;re thicker
here, you see, and we won&rsquo;t be able to tell what it&rsquo;s
doing till after we get around the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe had a habit of talking at a lively pace
when wishing to keep his heart from betraying his
nervousness. It was somewhat on the principle that
a boy whistles as loud as he can when passing a
country graveyard.</p>
<p>Half a minute later, and in a bunch the four
scouts turned a flank movement around the bushes.
Step Hen and Giraffe almost dropped with sheer
astonishment, and had to actually sustain each
other. No wonder, when before them they saw the
motionless form of a huge bear, that had evidently
been shot in a dozen places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">FINDING OUT HOW BUMPUS DID IT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo; Giraffe demanded,
as, with his comrades, he presently hurried
forward to examine the dead bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said Bumpus could do it, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; questioned
Step Hen. &ldquo;Why, with the great run of
luck he&rsquo;s camping alongside now, that pard of ours
could go into the lion and elephant country of
Africa, and knock over more old tuskers and yellow
manes than you could shake a stick at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how d&rsquo;ye know he did this?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe, as a new doubt assailed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me who else could?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; they did; don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on; &ldquo;but we happen to know there are
a couple of men hanging around this section of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Hank and Pierre, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re the dodgers. Now, you see, they
just might have come up here, found the bear holdin&rsquo;
Bumpus up in a tree, and took a notion to knock
the old mountain bear silly, just so they could look
our chum over, and take all he had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen was unable to hazard a reply to this,
and so he appealed to those who ought to be able
to decide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Thad, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both shook their heads in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Bumpus all the credit of downing this
bear,&rdquo; Thad remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots of things that go to prove it,&rdquo;
said Allan. &ldquo;Look here, and I&rsquo;ll show you. See,
here&rsquo;s where he knelt to fire, first of all, and I want
you to notice what a dandy tree for climbing Bumpus
picked out, just alongside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he&rsquo;d rammed in both charges, only
to see the bear coming full tilt after him, like a
house afire, Bumpus swung up in the tree&mdash;is that
it, Allan?&rdquo; and Giraffe looked wise as he said
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he did,&rdquo; Allan went on to say. &ldquo;I
reckon he had a stout cord fixed on his gun, and
could slip one arm through this, so that the Marlin
went up when he did, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he the cute one, though?&rdquo; Step Hen murmured,
in admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can see how the bear clawed the
tree,&rdquo; continued Allan, &ldquo;but he wasn&rsquo;t able to get
up. Grizzlies are poor climbers anyway, and this
fellow must have been handicapped by that injured
hind leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Bumpus, he opened on him, didn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; Giraffe cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s what he did,&rdquo; laughed
Thad. &ldquo;I can count <i>twelve</i> empty shells here under
the tree. Two Bumpus used at long range, but all
the rest he must have fired point-blank, with the
bear not more than five or ten feet away from the
muzzle of his gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye tell that?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here, and here you can see the hair on the
bear looks singed around a wound. That proves
the gun was only a few feet away. And notice
too, boys, nearly every shot took effect either in the
breast or back of the bear. The one that finished
him was this in the ear. It penetrated his brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe gave one of his whistles, and then remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory! but there must have been a hot time
around here, all right. I can just imagine I see
Bumpus perched up in that crotch, and blazing
away as fast as he could load. What a circus it
was, and such great luck. Why, that feller could
grab the first prize in the Havana lottery if he ever
wanted to go down to Cuba and take a chance.
He can sure do anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got his bear, bless his dear old heart,&rdquo;
laughed Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and just like he did with the bob-cat; only
this time, he hacked off the claws from all four
feet. Must mean to have &rsquo;em made into a war
necklace, Indian fashion,&rdquo; observed Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks some like a slaughter-house around
here,&rdquo; Giraffe said. &ldquo;The bear bled from every
wound. They told us a grizzly could stand any
amount of lead, and now I believe it. Why, at
that close range, them buckshot in his gun just tore
in like a great big fifty-eight slug. Oh! what a
sight, if Davy had only been here with his snapshot
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can see that Hank and Pierre came right
along in,&rdquo; observed Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and looked around, just like we&rsquo;re doing
now,&rdquo; Allan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m some surprised that they didn&rsquo;t capture the
skin of the bear,&rdquo; the other went on. &ldquo;Bumpus
couldn&rsquo;t take it off, because that&rsquo;s one thing he
hasn&rsquo;t learned&mdash;yet. But surely Hank or Pierre
must be old trappers enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Allan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They looked at it, and quickly decided it wasn&rsquo;t
worth taking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First place, Bumpus had
hacked all the fierce claws off, and they&rsquo;re the best
part of a grizzly pelt, I&rsquo;m told. Then our chum
had, as you can see, just about riddled the hide;
shot holes through every which way. That&rsquo;s probably
why they didn&rsquo;t bother trying to take the skin
off the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;did they keep on after Bumpus?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say they did,&rdquo; admitted Allan, who
with his customary alertness had been looking
around, and taking note of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, we will be on the move again,&rdquo;
Giraffe declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be getting away any too soon to suit
me,&rdquo; Step Hen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things I&rsquo;m sorry about are these,&rdquo; remarked
Thad. &ldquo;First, it&rsquo;s getting along in the
afternoon now, and our chances of overtaking
either the men or Bumpus before darkness comes on
are mighty small, I&rsquo;m afraid. You see they&rsquo;ve got
quite a few hours&rsquo; advantage over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not make a torch or so, and keep
moving along, even after night does set in,&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe, quickly, for his mind was always
inclining toward fire in some shape or style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that may not be such a bad idea at all,
Giraffe,&rdquo; Thad promptly declared. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad
you mentioned it. If we&rsquo;re not too leg-weary after
we&rsquo;ve eaten, and rested an hour or two, we might
try that scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it didn&rsquo;t do anything else,&rdquo; put in Allan, &ldquo;it
would surely cut down the big lead they&rsquo;ve got on
us, and we might be close enough when we started
at dawn again, to get Bumpus with the call of the
Silver Fox Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than that, even,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;if we kept
moving right along to-night who knows but what
we might have the luck to glimpse a camp-fire. Remember
how we did that before, and thought to surprise
our chum; when it turned out the other way,
and we got all the surprise from Hank and Pierre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose fire would this be, d&rsquo;ye think&mdash;Bumpus&rsquo;,
or Hank&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps both,&rdquo; was the significant reply Thad
made. &ldquo;For unless they&rsquo;ve changed their minds,
and concluded not to meddle with a tenderfoot
scout who was able to kill a full grown grizzly all
by himself, I take it that before now Bumpus and
the timber cruisers have joined forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the lion and the lamb lying down together
without the least bit of trouble, because the lamb
was <i>inside</i> the lion,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the chances are that they&rsquo;ve bulldozed our
chum, and made him wait upon them like a slave,
cook their meals for them; and perhaps they will
tie him up in camp to-night, so he won&rsquo;t have a
chance to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen fairly gnashed his teeth while drawing
this agonizing mental picture of the further troubles
of Bumpus. And even those who had the most
faith in the fat scout&rsquo;s newly aroused ability to
think, and take care of himself, could hardly see
how the awkward lad might come out of such an
encounter as this with any degree of credit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Being up against two husky and unprincipled
men, who had brains with which to plot and scheme,
was an entirely different proposition from meeting
animals that acted only from instinct, and often
very unwisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, Thad,&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen,
&ldquo;you said a while ago there were two reasons for
you feeling sorry, and the first was that it was getting
late, and we might have to camp soon. What
was the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; the patrol leader continued; &ldquo;knowing
that these hard characters are abroad, between us
and Bumpus, even if they haven&rsquo;t made a prisoner
of our chum, you see, we&rsquo;re kept from doing any
more shouting out loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just why?&rdquo; asked the other, dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would only advertise our presence to the
pair, and they could lay a trap to snare us. Perhaps
they&rsquo;d make Bumpus lure us on, or even imitate
his voice and catch us napping. As it is now,&rdquo;
Thad went on, &ldquo;so far as we know, they don&rsquo;t
even suspect that we&rsquo;re around. If we can keep
them from knowing right along, our job&rsquo;s going to
be all the easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; said Allan, emphatically.</p>
<p>And even the other two could see the force of his
reasoning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>There was nothing to do, therefore, but keep
steadily along, trusting to their perseverance to
bring them a reward in the end. None of them
dared to even dream that the astonishing good luck
that had followed Bumpus ever since he found
himself lost in the big timber, would not continue
with him to the end.</p>
<p>The best they could figure on was that if their
chum had fallen into the hands of the two husky
timber spies, they would be tired enough to go into
camp soon after, and make the boy do all the work
of getting supper.</p>
<p>And while they thus dallied, dreaming of no danger,
the four scouts might be advancing steadily,
rod after rod, making use of a rude torch in order
to see the trail, and all the while drawing nearer
the crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be apt to hurt Bumpus,
do you, Thad?&rdquo; the war-like Step Hen asked, for
the third time, as they continued to press on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not seriously,&rdquo; replied the scoutmaster. &ldquo;We
know they are bullies on the face of it, but really
cowards at heart. If they hadn&rsquo;t been that, d&rsquo;ye
suppose for one minute they would ever have bombarded
us while we slept, as they thought, with
great rocks, any one of which might have broken
our arms or legs? And if they&rsquo;ve got hold of Bumpus,
just because he&rsquo;s a scout, and our friend, they&rsquo;d
likely kick him around a lot, and make him knuckle
down to them; but I hardly believe they&rsquo;d hurt him
badly. But no matter what they do, they&rsquo;ve got to
settle with Bumpus&rsquo; chums, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, right glad to hear you say that, Thad,&rdquo;
declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know how you feel,&rdquo; the scoutmaster
went on, &ldquo;and it does you a lot of credit too, for
scouts should stand by each other through thick
and thin. But go slow, Step Hen, go slow. We
don&rsquo;t want to do any shooting, if it can be avoided;
and then, remember, only pepper their legs. We
belong to an organization that stands for <i>peace</i>
every time, and no scout can be permitted to do any
violence, unless it is to actually save his own life,
or that of a chum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I understand all that, Thad; make your
mind easy,&rdquo; declared Step Hen, jauntily. &ldquo;What
I&rsquo;d like to do in case those curs have kicked and
pounded poor old Bumpus, would be to just give
&rsquo;em each forty whacks on the bare back with that
bull whip we use on Mike and Molly, our pack
mules, when they get too stubborn for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that ain&rsquo;t a bad idea, Step Hen,&rdquo; asserted
Giraffe, nodding his head until, perched on such a
long neck, it reminded Thad of a wooden manikin
he had seen working as an advertisement in a shop
window where razors were sold. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a pretty
good scheme&mdash;for you, Step Hen; but I can go you
one better. We ought to just tar and feather such
rascals, take their guns away, and ride &rsquo;em out of
camp on a rail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last part could be done easy enough,&rdquo; Step
Hen declared; &ldquo;but that other about the tar and
feathers is too silly for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it, I&rsquo;d just like to know?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been done hundreds of times, down
South, out West, and even up North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt it&rsquo;s a heap of satisfaction
to them that apply the feathers. Something
like the old fable &lsquo;fun for the boys, but death to
the frogs.&rsquo; But tell me, Giraffe, please where would
you get the tar, up in this big timber wilderness?
And how about the feathers&mdash;got a pillow handy
you can rip open?&rdquo; and Step Hen laughed in the
face of the long scout, feeling that he had by far the
best of the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks! guess that did kinder slip my
mind,&rdquo; grumbled Giraffe; and he felt so humiliated
over his defeat in the wordy war that for five full
minutes he actually remained as mute as the sphinx;
and it generally took a good deal to keep Giraffe
silent that long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Of course they were constantly on the lookout
for any signs ahead of those whose trail they followed.
But they had very little hope of stumbling
upon such a piece of good luck as overtaking them
before night set in.</p>
<p>According to the latest report from Allan, in
whom they all felt the utmost confidence, some hours
had passed, perhaps four or more, since Hank and
his French-Canadian partner had made those footprints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have been catching up on Bumpus
right along,&rdquo; he had also announced in the same
breath. &ldquo;If they were two hours behind at the
spot where the bear was killed, they&rsquo;ve cut that
down to one at the time they passed here. And
going at the same rate of speed I should say they&rsquo;d
overtake our chum about a couple of miles away
from this spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they made up their minds to camp right
away then,&rdquo; said Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anything,
and I can keep on as long as the next one;
but this right&mdash;left, which old leg is it, anyway&mdash;feels
sore sometimes, and then numb-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid mine&rsquo;s swelling just a little,
Thad,&rdquo; ventured Step Hen. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps there was
some poison in that snake bite after all, and you
didn&rsquo;t suck it all out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; remarked the scoutmaster,
cheerily. &ldquo;Both of you are using your lame limb
more than you should, that&rsquo;s all. But that can&rsquo;t be
helped, because we&rsquo;re bound to find our chum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Giraffe, sturdily, &ldquo;even if it takes
a leg, as they say. But suppose, now, those men do
come up with Bumpus, I reckon they&rsquo;ll make out to
be friendly hunters, sent out by some of us to find
him; because they know a lot about the scouts.
Step Hen here jabbered like an old woman, when
we believed Hank was the forest ranger, Toby
Smathers, we&rsquo;d been told to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not near so much as you did yourself, Giraffe,&rdquo;
remonstrated Step Hen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing I will
admit you stand in a class by yourself&mdash;talking;
yes, and in the making of fires at any old time and
place. But of course they&rsquo;ll fool Bumpus that easy,
he&rsquo;s so confiding, so free from suspicion himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, before he knows what&rsquo;s happening,
they&rsquo;ll switch his gun out of his hands, give him a
few hard kicks, and just treat him like a dog. Oh!
it fairly makes my blood boil just to think of it,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on to say, while he frowned, and
gnashed his teeth in a way that must have seriously
alarmed the objects of his detestation, could they
have been near enough to see and hear.</p>
<p>But unfortunately it was all wasted, for both
Hank and Pierre were miles away at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that yonder?&rdquo; exclaimed Thad, startling
the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you believe it, looks like an old stake
and rider country fence, left alone to go to the waste
years ago?&rdquo; Allan announced, after taking a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a sign we&rsquo;re getting near some
village, I take it,&rdquo; declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed aloud when he heard this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a goose you are, Step Hen,&rdquo; he remarked,
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! am I? See any down coming along?&rdquo; demanded
the other, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do&mdash;on your upper lip,&rdquo; Giraffe went on.
&ldquo;Noticed it only the other day; and thought then
that if you keep on for a dozen years or so, we&rsquo;ll
expect you to be sportin&rsquo; as fine a moustache as the
one old Jerry William has been coaxing along this
half century. You know, the Cranford boys liken
it to a baseball game, because there are nine on one
side and nine on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why was I silly when I said we might run
across a village up here?&rdquo; Step Hen persisted, being
just bound to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we were told that there wasn&rsquo;t such a
thing within fifty miles of this same place, except
the little settlement where we got our pack mules,&rdquo;
the tall scout went on to say, convincingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was a fence, all right,&rdquo; Step Hen
avowed. &ldquo;I heard Allan say so; and I guess I
know a fence when I see one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, don&rsquo;t talk of a fence now, Step Hen.
I think if you ask Thad, he&rsquo;ll tell you some feller
must a tried to hold out up here, and gave it up from
sheer loneliness. Either that, or else the Injuns got
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injuns!&rdquo; repeated Step Hen, apparently
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Giraffe went on, for he was a great
tease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Thad?&rdquo; and the other scout
turned to the patrol leader; because it had long ago
become second nature with the members of the
Silver Fox Patrol to put all arguments up to him
for settlement; and it was really remarkable how
satisfied both sides usually seemed with his decisions,
since they had absolute faith in Thad as a just
judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I rather expect Giraffe is yarning a little
when he says the man may have been wiped out by
the Indians,&rdquo; the scoutmaster replied, laughingly.
&ldquo;Fact is, the chances would be, some trappers come
up here each season, and likely spent the whole
winter reaping a harvest, returning in the Spring
with their take. If we had time to look around,
which we haven&rsquo;t, I reckon we&rsquo;d stumble on a concealed
cabin somewhere in the thickest of the timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! must be cold, all right, in winter. Talk
about your zero, I guess the bottom drops out of
the thermometer up here,&rdquo; Giraffe ventured to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt it is cold, because we&rsquo;re not a great
distance from the border line of the British Northwest
provinces. But then, these fur takers expect
that. The further north you go the better the fur,&rdquo;
Thad remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a well-known fact,&rdquo; added Allan. &ldquo;One
trapper told me that the skin of a muskrat or a
raccoon, taken away up in Canada, was worth three
of the same captured down in Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;I can
understand why the fur is heavier and richer. Old
Nature provides it according to the weather. If
it&rsquo;s a country with hardly any winter, why the fur
is thin; and just the other way where it&rsquo;s bitter cold
for many months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that fence?&rdquo; Step Hen went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him still harping on that fence business!&rdquo;
jeered Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Thad went on to say, pleasantly, &ldquo;perhaps
one year these trappers tried to stay through
the summer too, and put up a fence to keep their
horses from straying, and falling prey to the wild
beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen seemed satisfied, because the explanation
appeared natural. So for a while they kept
plodding on in almost complete silence.</p>
<p>Both lame boys limped more or less. Thad
noticed this, and concluded that they deserved a
rest, especially since the afternoon was creeping
along, and already the timber began to look a little
shadowy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>So he mentioned the fact to Allan, who immediately
resolved to keep a bright lookout for a nice
spring of cool water, alongside of which they
might stop, build a little fire, and take things comfortable
for a while.</p>
<p>Luckily this chanced to appear very shortly. Although
they would not say as much, being too
proud to complain, Step Hen and Giraffe were
secretly glad of the chance to rest. They talked
valorously, however, of what great stunts they
would be ready to perform after they devoured
some supper, and had taken things a little easy.</p>
<p>Thad knew, however, that it would really require
something of an effort to get the boys started
afresh. The two hours&rsquo; rest would refresh their
energies, but stiffen their sore legs, more or less.</p>
<p>Giraffe attended to the fire part of the business,
as usual, and Step Hen hovered near by, ready to
assist with what little cooking they might have to
do. Thad sat there, examining some rough charts
he had made of the country, as he knew it; and figuring
on just where the camp by the rapids, occupied
by Bob White, Davy Jones and Smithy,
must be.</p>
<p>Allan had started to take a look around the
vicinity, and it was hardly more than ten minutes
when he was heard calling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Thad, come here, and give me a hand,
will you? I&rsquo;m caught fast in a trap!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE CRIPPLE BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE CONTAGIOUS.</span></h2>
<p>Of course these words from their comrade gave
the other three Boy Scouts quite a shock. Giraffe
was on his knees by the fire, and he immediately
started to crane his neck, twisting his head in every
direction. Step Hen very wisely first of all removed
the little extra coffee-pot they had brought
along, and set it safely on the ground, before scrambling
to his feet.</p>
<p>Thad was already hurrying off. Not knowing
what Allan meant by being in a &ldquo;trap&rdquo; the sagacious
scoutmaster made sure to carry his gun along
with him. And seeing this, the other two did likewise.
In that wonderful country so close to the
mountains, there was no telling what sudden necessity
might arise for a means of defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Allan?&rdquo; called Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>The woods were partly in darkness. It was possible
to see the tree trunks, but all else seemed vague.
This, of course, was partly caused by the fact of
the boys having had their eyes dazzled by the glowing
fire. Had they stood there for ten minutes,
until used to the semi-gloom, doubtless they could
have distinguished objects around them much more
readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; came in Allan&rsquo;s voice, and rather
close by. &ldquo;No great hurry, boys; but I&rsquo;ve tried
to get out myself, and can&rsquo;t turn around so as to
reach the spring, and step on it with the other
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring!&rdquo; echoed Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because I&rsquo;m held fast in the grip of an old
rusty bear trap, that must have been left here last
season by the trappers,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! what d&rsquo;ye think about that?&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe.</p>
<p>They were now close to where Allan could be seen
standing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt much, Allan?&rdquo; demanded Thad,
horrified at the idea of the other having a badly-mangled
leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it hurts some, but I guess the old trap
must have a pretty weak set of springs, and that&rsquo;s
why they purposely left it behind. But if it didn&rsquo;t
get a bear, it caught me by the leg, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which leg?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen, quickly; but
Thad spoke up before the question could be
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better have some light here to work
by, Allan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea, because
there are two springs, and they ought to be held
down at the same time,&rdquo; the victim of the trap
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked the patrol
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want a torch?&rdquo; exclaimed the fire
builder, eagerly. &ldquo;Oh! just give me a minute or
so, and I&rsquo;ll fix you out quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he whirled around in his tracks, and
started to go back toward the fire, with great
bounds, that would have done credit to a leaping
deer. When those long &ldquo;spindle&rdquo; legs of Giraffe
got to working properly, they were capable of
covering ground at a tremendous rate. And if he
had a few stitches of pain, because of that bad
stone bruise, Giraffe paid little attention to it, so engrossed
was he in carrying out the order to get a
torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not hurt much, Allan?&rdquo; said
Thad, solicitously, as he reached the side of his
chum, and began feeling for the trap with both
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as comfortable as it might be,&rdquo; admitted
the other, with a nervous little laugh, &ldquo;and I guess
I&rsquo;ll have to join the ranks of the limpers for a few
days; but then, think how much worse it might
have been, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean if the trap had been new instead of
worn out, Allen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, with the springs good, and strong
enough to hold even a big bear. Whew! I guess
I&rsquo;m some lucky at that. And then, if I didn&rsquo;t have
a lot of splendid chums close at hand to help me, I
might have a tough time getting out myself; because,
you see, they staked the old trap down to
the ground, and I just don&rsquo;t seem able to turn far
enough to get at the second spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warrant you&rsquo;ve been trying, all right,&rdquo; suggested
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet I have,&rdquo; chuckled Allan, &ldquo;for five
minutes or so, turning and twisting. You see, I
didn&rsquo;t want the rest of you to know how I&rsquo;d stepped
plumb into an old bear trap, hidden under the dead
leaves here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course you couldn&rsquo;t make it?&rdquo; Thad
continued, watching Giraffe waving a blazing brand
about his head to induce it to flame up better, as he
left the fire, and started toward the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to own up at last,&rdquo; admitted Allan, &ldquo;because
it hurt badly every time I tried to turn
around. But now it will be all right; for here&rsquo;s
Giraffe and his light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A good torch she is, too,&rdquo; declared the long
scout, coming up just then; &ldquo;burns just like that
fat pine or light wood we had down in North
Carolina. My! what an immense trap. It must
pinch that leg of yours some, Allan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get around on that side, Step Hen,&rdquo; ordered
Thad, &ldquo;and be sure, once you stand on the spring,
not to get off until I give the word; because if you
did, it will close the jaws as quick as that, and perhaps
do more damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I understand, Thad,&rdquo; said Step Hen,
starting to follow out directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Giraffe, hold the light so both of us
can see,&rdquo; continued Thad. &ldquo;There, steady now.
All ready. Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then push down hard and steady. There she
comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan had taken hold of the jaws of the old bear
trap, and no sooner did the pressure exerted by the
two side springs cease, than he was able to push
them wide apart.</p>
<p>He immediately snatched his leg out of the trap,
and no sooner had he done so than he rolled over
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my stars!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
hurt more&rsquo;n he knows of. What if he&rsquo;s got a
broken leg? Wouldn&rsquo;t we be in a nice pickle
though?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so bad as that, boys,&rdquo; said Allan, who
was feeling of the calf of his leg as he lay on
his back, &ldquo;though it hurts quite some. But help
me up, Thad, and we&rsquo;ll get to the fire. By the
time I&rsquo;ve used my leg a little, and you get some of
that magic liniment soaked on the spot, I guess I&rsquo;ll
make out, and be able to start when the rest of
you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan was full of pluck. Moreover, he was an
unusually hardy boy, for he had always spent a
good part of his time outdoors; and there is nothing
more calculated to build up a lad&rsquo;s system than
that.</p>
<p>He limped some, of course, as he headed toward
the fire; but when Allan put those firm lips of his
tightly together, nothing of an ordinary character
at least, could force him to groan, or even admit
that he suffered.</p>
<p>Once by the fire he sat down. Step Hen went
on with his simple cooking operations, while Thad,
assisted by the ready Giraffe, started to look at
the hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky I had on my leggings,&rdquo; remarked Allan.
&ldquo;With those, and my trouser leg underneath, it
made more or less of a bumper. And then again,
you know, traps are never made with teeth nowadays,
like they used to be. A man told me they
found that the old style lacerated the leg of the animal
so much, they used to lose a third of their
catch; for the fox or the mink or the otter would
either pull and squirm till he&rsquo;d amputated his leg,
or else gnaw it off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gnaw it off&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you romancing, now,
Allan?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s
often been done, though trappers are divided in
their opinion about it. Some think the animal deliberately
gnaws its leg off, ready to make the
sacrifice for the sake of liberty. Others say that
an animal naturally bites at anything that hurts
it; and it&rsquo;s while snapping at the jaws of the trap
they keep on tearing at their wounded and broken
leg, till it gives way. Anyhow, there are always a
number of poor three-legged small animals in the
woods where trapping is done. I&rsquo;ve seen a red
fox that was minus a leg; and I tell you right now,
the way he could get over ground was a caution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Allan was talking along in this fashion,
doling out interesting information, he was rolling
up the leg of his trousers, though Thad could see
him wince a little as though it gave him pain to
do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a black and blue place on each side,&rdquo;
Allan went on to say, as if surprised not to discover
a worse looking wound. &ldquo;Funny how that
could hurt as much as it does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me put on the liniment, and then
bind it up,&rdquo; remarked Thad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it cooling;
and I warrant it&rsquo;s going to help along a lot.
These black and blue bruises are always mighty
painful. That&rsquo;s where you got the blow, and the
blood&rsquo;s already settling there. This stuff will help
to keep it moving, for there&rsquo;s witch hazel in it, and
that, you know, is really the extract of hamamelis.
How&rsquo;s that now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feels better, yes, fifty per cent better,&rdquo; declared
Allan, as the amateur scout surgeon fastened the
wet bandage snugly with a couple of safety pins,
and started to draw down the leg of the other&rsquo;s
trousers, so the outside covering of canvas legging
could be replaced.</p>
<p>After this had all been done, Allan got up, and
commenced to walk around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of trying out myself, you know, boys,&rdquo;
he remarked, laughingly, to hide any grimace of
pain, his actions might be causing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; asked Thad, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than I expected,&rdquo; the other replied.
&ldquo;Excuse me if I limp around some, boys, but I
think it&rsquo;ll let the liniment work in better, to keep
it warmed up. Oh! I&rsquo;ve a lot to be thankful for,
let me tell you. I&rsquo;m not putting up any sort of
kick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Thad, with a good-natured
smile, &ldquo;all I can say is, that you fellows are working
the family doctor to the limit these days. What
with stone bruises, snake bites, and getting caught
in bear traps, I&rsquo;m making a big hole in the stock
of salve and liniment I fetched along. I suppose
it&rsquo;s going to be my turn next. Perhaps you may
have to make a stretcher, and carry me back to
camp with a broken leg, or something like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, I hope not,&rdquo; exclaimed
Allan. &ldquo;Just imagine the alarm of the other fellows
when a procession of limpers came in sight,
carrying another. And with our chum Bumpus an
unknown quantity too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he got lamed up too; wouldn&rsquo;t that
just be the limit?&rdquo; chuckled Giraffe, who often
saw humor where no one else did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; spoke up Step Hen, still busy at
the fire, and there was an air of satisfaction in his
voice, Giraffe instantly noted, &ldquo;Allan belongs in <i>my</i>
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; instantly demanded the jealous
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Just use your eyes, and you won&rsquo;t need
to ask so many foolish questions. Don&rsquo;t you see
how he limps when he puts that old <i>right</i> leg
down? Well, it was my right one that got the
snake bite. Allan and me make up the right leg
brigade. You&rsquo;ll just have to herd by yourself, Giraffe&mdash;anyhow
till somebody else takes a notion to
drop in the fire, or cut his toe with the wood axe,
or somethin&rsquo; like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad and Allan laughed at the comical way in
which the peculiar condition of things was described
by Step Hen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the scoutmaster, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hope that
won&rsquo;t happen. Better Giraffe should stay in a class
all by himself to the end of the chapter, than another
fellow meet with a serious accident. We&rsquo;ve
got cripples enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this ends the run of hard luck,&rdquo; declared
the Maine boy, still keeping up his movements,
although perhaps unconsciously favoring
the injured leg, as any one is apt to do under similar
conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;ye say that?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you know they always say accidents come
in threes,&rdquo; Allan replied, cheerfully. &ldquo;The
women folks in our house used always to believe
that, anyhow; and this makes three of us hobbling
around. If we were at home now, perhaps
we&rsquo;d be wanting to use crutches; but up here in
the woods we just grin and bear it like true scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Giraffe went on, &ldquo;guess you&rsquo;re right
about women folks believin&rsquo; in a broken looking-glass
standing for coming trouble, and all such
things; though my dad used to say he had all the
trouble settle on him in paying for a new mirror.
But honest to goodness, fellers, I remember once
when my maw, she chanced to drop some dishes,
and busted two&mdash;what does she do but walks right
over to the dresser, gets out a cracked tumbler she
must a been keepin&rsquo; for just such a time to come
along; and I give you my word, I nearly took a
fit when she just deliberately smashed that down
alongside the broken crockery, and I heard her say,
says she: &lsquo;There! that makes <i>three</i> now!&rsquo; just as
if that ended it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; announced Step Hen, when
the laughter induced by Giraffe&rsquo;s little story had
subsided.</p>
<p>The coffee tasted just as good as ever. Besides,
they had some venison, cooked in the hunter&rsquo;s primitive
way, each piece having been pierced by a long
splinter of wood, the other end being stuck in the
ground, so that the meat was close enough to the
red coals to cook without burning&mdash;too much.</p>
<p>Perhaps at home, with a white table-cloth, silver,
cut glass, and all the ordinary &ldquo;fixings&rdquo;
around them, some of those boys might have
viewed the suspicious looks of those half-cooked
pieces of meat with more or less hesitation. But
appetite ruled here, and every one declared it was
&ldquo;just prime.&rdquo; And if a fellow found that his
meat, while scorched on the outside, was nearly raw
in the center, why, you know, all good cook&rsquo;s unite
in saying game should always be juicy and underdone,
rather than dry and overdone&mdash;Step Hen
had read it in his mother&rsquo;s precious cook-book at
home, and boldly said so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>When they were done eating they just lay around
talking and resting. It was very comfortable, and
neither Giraffe nor Step Hen felt in the least like
making any change. But they knew that after a
while, when the determined scoutmaster thought
they had rested long enough, he would give the
order that must once more see them limping along
the trail, a band of cripples.</p>
<p>Of course the talk was mostly about Bumpus, and what chances they had of
finding him unharmed. For, despite the faith Thad professed to have in
the extraordinary good luck of the fat scout, there were times when even
his stout heart became a prey to misgivings; and in his mind he saw poor
Bumpus being badly treated by those two bullies, the timber cruisers.
</p>
<p>Latterly Allan had been selecting several good
pieces of wood calculated to burn well, and serve
as torches.</p>
<p>When Thad finally gave the word, they prepared
to depart. One of the splinters of wood, taken
from a near-by tree that must have been riven by
a bolt of lightning in the recent storm, was lighted.
Then they saw that the camp-fire was carefully put
out, after which Allan, bearing the torch, found
the trail, and started off.</p>
<p>They kept this up for over an hour. Not one
of them murmured, though no doubt their lame
legs hurt considerably. But they remembered constantly
that they were scouts; and that as such,
their ability to stand pain was on trial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>It was the secret hope of every heart, however,
that very soon now they might discover signs calculated
to tell them they were drawing near the
end of their long pursuit of the lost tenderfoot.</p>
<p>The others were glad, therefore, when Old Eagle
Eye, as Step Hen persisted in terming Giraffe, suddenly
called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve sighted a camp-fire ahead, fellers!&rdquo;
was what he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE WAY BLOCKED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen, not in a shout,
but cautious like, as became a scout when danger
was near; still, he was thrilled by the information
which this announcement from Giraffe contained.</p>
<p>If there was a fire beyond, the chances seemed
pretty good that they would soon know the truth
with regard to Bumpus. Of course they kept on
hoping for the best; but almost anything would be
preferable to this anxiety that had been gnawing so
long at their hearts, it had nearly worn them out.</p>
<p>Allan thrust his burning torch into the ground,
behind a neighboring tree, so that its light might no
longer blind his eyes when he tried to see the fire
Giraffe had discovered.</p>
<p>After all of them had been directed just where to
look, by the exulting scout whose sharp vision had
first located the far-off light, it was easily decided
that there could be no doubt as to its being a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>And as the trail ran about that way, in a general
direction, of course they were perfectly safe in believing
that some, or all, of those they had been so
persistently following, would be found alongside
that fire.</p>
<p>The very thought gave them a delicious thrill.
By another hour then, perhaps in even less time than
that, they would likely know the worst. And if, as
several of them secretly feared, those two ugly
brutes of timber cruisers had dared lay so much as
the weight of their heavy hands in anger on Bumpus,
or ventured to kick him around as though he were
a slave&mdash;well, something unpleasant was going to
happen to them, that was positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire, all right,&rdquo; announced Thad; and
Giraffe breathed easier, for he had been entertaining
a slight fear lest some of his laurels be snatched
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all of a mile from here,&rdquo; Allan remarked.
&ldquo;I wonder however you discovered it, Giraffe, with
all these big trees around. There must be just a
little opening ahead, and you hit on that avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Giraffe, as if carelessly, though he
was undoubtedly secretly pleased with such words
of commendation from one who had had such long
experience in the art of woodcraft as the Maine boy;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the good of having eyes unless you use &rsquo;em?
That was just dead easy&mdash;for me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the question is, what do we want to do&mdash;what
would seem to be our best course?&rdquo; Thad went
on to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate you are referring to the torch business?&rdquo;
Allan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied the scoutmaster, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got to decide right now whether to keep on using
it for a while longer, or stamp on the same, and
make our way ahead the best way possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not keep on with the light?&rdquo; asked
Step Hen, who was wondering whether in the darkness
he might not be so dreadfully unfortunate as to
step on another of those &ldquo;fighting snakes,&rdquo; and have
his <i>left</i> leg put out of commission also, which would
be a dreadful catastrophe indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s always a chance one of those
sharp timber cruisers would see it bobbin&rsquo; along, and
that would put them on their guard. We had one
experience in that line, you know, fellers, when they
heard us coming, and got all ready to receive us. I
don&rsquo;t like ever to stamp out a fire, but if you say
the word, Thad, out it goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think on the whole,&rdquo; remarked the patrol
leader, &ldquo;it would be wiser for us to do it. Let&rsquo;s locate
that fire by the stars, or any other old way. Now,
you can douse the glim, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the tall scout trampled on the partly-burned
torch until the very last spark had been extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hated to do it, but orders is orders,&rdquo; Giraffe
was heard to mutter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to him, would you?&rdquo; said Step Hen,
scornfully. &ldquo;He feels that way about all the fires he
makes, too; just hates to put &rsquo;em out. Makes me
think of an old aunt I have. She raises chickens,
but never has any to eat. Why, she says she might
as soon eat a baby, as a hen she&rsquo;d raised, and talked
to, and made a pet of. Don&rsquo;t ketch me being so old-womanish
and silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that they were in darkness, it would of
course make their progress slower, since they had to
reckon on all sorts of obstacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said Allan, as they started out, &ldquo;I
think I can come back to this same place in the
morning, if we should want to find it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would we want to find it for?&rdquo; Step
Hen demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t believe we will; but it might happen,
you see, that we&rsquo;d have to take up the trail again
from here,&rdquo; Allan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean in case we lost the fire, or didn&rsquo;t find
Bumpus with those two rascals?&rdquo; Giraffe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the Maine boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;re you agoin&rsquo; to find this place
again?&rdquo; Step Hen went on to inquire, &ldquo;all coons
look alike to me; and one part of this big timber
strikes me as pretty much the same as the rest,
&rsquo;specially when you see it at night time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wait, and Allan, he&rsquo;ll tell you how,&rdquo; broke
in Giraffe, confidently. He felt sure from the way
Allan spoke that he knew what he was saying; and
after seeing how cleverly the Maine boy had stuck
to the trail, when the marks were all Greek to himself
and Step Hen, the tall scout had come to have
a sincere admiration for Allan.</p>
<p>Besides, just then it happened that Giraffe was
feeling pretty good. He had received a very high
compliment from the acting scoutmaster, and that is
usually a great victory for any ambitious scout.</p>
<p>Why, he almost forgot he was tired to death, and
that his injured leg had been paining him furiously.
Such an affect can mind have over matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Allan, off-hand, and in no particular
hurry to speak, because they all really needed a little
breathing spell before going on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s generally dead
easy to mark most any place in the timber, if only
you use your eyes. There&rsquo;s nearly always some odd
old stump of a tree standing around that you&rsquo;d be
apt to know again. Sometimes there happens to be
a tree with a queer shape, that just catches your
eye. Once noticed, it&rsquo;s easy to remember the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And right now you&rsquo;re meaning that pair of trees
that have fallen toward each other till they look like
a couple of girls going to hug,&rdquo; spoke up Giraffe,
quickly; eager to show that those boasted eagle eyes
of his had been able to see more than just the campfire
far ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing. Giraffe, and I&rsquo;m glad you noticed
them, because two heads are better than one, any
day,&rdquo; Allan went on to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even if one is&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; Step Hen
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you better not,&rdquo; snapped Giraffe. &ldquo;But
now that we&rsquo;ve decided on that little tree test of
memory, hadn&rsquo;t we better be going ahead? I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo; of our poor chum Bumpus, and what he
may be enduring right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; declared Thad, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve rested enough,
and might just as well be putting our best foot forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanin&rsquo; the right leg,&rdquo; muttered Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong&mdash;it&rsquo;s the left one with Allan
and me, and majority rules in our patrol, you know,&rdquo;
chuckled Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys, I&rsquo;ve got the bearings pretty well,
if that star only stays out from behind the clouds
that hide the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad, upon speaking in this strain, started, with
Allan alongside to give council, and insure progress
along direct lines.</p>
<p>Having had much more experience than the other
pair of scouts they were not only able to keep in a
fairly direct line with the fire, but managed to avoid
stumbling over obstacles as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Giraffe and Step Hen proved less fortunate. Several
times they stepped into holes, or else tripped
over vines. And each mishap was accompanied by
more or less of a crash, as well as much grumbling
from the unfortunate one, and perhaps chuckling
from the other.</p>
<p>This would never do in the wide world. Either
they must slow up still more, so as to give the stumblers
a chance to pick their way more carefully, or
else those better able to move along without trouble
would have to take Giraffe and Step Hen in tow.</p>
<p>It was decided that the latter method would be
better, all things considered. And so Thad convoyed
Giraffe, while Allan slipped a hand through
the right arm of Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Case of the blind leading the blind, I guess,&rdquo;
muttered the latter, grimly, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve both
got a game right leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any more than you have to, Step
Hen,&rdquo; cautioned the other.</p>
<p>So they moved along for some time. At any rate
it seemed to go better now. The stumbles were
fewer, and of less consequence, and naturally, as
the two who lacked experience in this sort of thing,
became more and more proficient, their confidence
arose accordingly.</p>
<p>Now and then they were able to discover the beacon
light that was drawing them along. And in this
particular the really sharp eyes of Giraffe proved of
great help. Several times he was able to direct
Thad&rsquo;s attention to the light when even the scoutmaster
had failed to discover it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>But all this while their progress seemed to continue
in such a direct forward line that both Giraffe
and Step Hen were amazed. They could not understand
how it was done, with all those trees, and other
obstacles, to avoid.</p>
<p>Some boys seem to be natural-born woodsmen.
It comes easy to such to adapt themselves to circumstances,
and learn all sorts of new &ldquo;wrinkles&rdquo; connected
with woodcraft. With others it is a hard
task, though determination to succeed is the main
thing. Before that will-power, few obstacles can
stand.</p>
<p>It was while the four scouts were making fair
progress through the timber in this manner, that
they suddenly ran up against another serious obstacle,
and one that for a time threatened to upset all
their calculations.</p>
<p>Allan suddenly gave the low bark of a fox, quickly
repeated twice. It brought the boys to a sudden
standstill, for they recognized the signal of danger.</p>
<p>The way was blocked!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;LITTLE LIGHTNING.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Step Hen, suddenly
turning cold with apprehension.</p>
<p>No doubt the first thought that flashed through
his mind was that those two unscrupulous timber
cruisers must in some remarkable manner have
learned of their coming again, as on the previous
occasion.</p>
<p>Perhaps Step Hen had just been thinking along
these lines, and was prepared to hear a gruff voice
call out to them that it was no use, and that they
had better surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way is blocked!&rdquo; said Allan, also in a low,
guarded voice, as the others crowded in toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way, Allan?&rdquo; asked Thad, anxiously,
his voice hardly louder than the soft murmuring
night wind that gently shivered the leaves overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look straight ahead,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
good I happened to glimpse the fellow before we
bumped into him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; ejaculated Step Hen.</p>
<p>He had of course done as Allan suggested, and to
his surprise discovered two glow worms, or fire
flies, or something similar, only they did not seem
to come and go, but just burned steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes,&rdquo; replied Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wolf?&rdquo; whispered Step Hen, apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely a panther,&rdquo; Thad answered back.</p>
<p>They were all half crouching there, with nervous
hands clutching their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; said Allan, with decision in
his voice and manner. &ldquo;A wolf would be too
much of a coward to stay so long. And listen
closely, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! I can hear the old cat growling to himself,&rdquo;
said Giraffe.</p>
<p>Thad felt his comrade make a hasty little move.
Then his quick ear caught the click of a gun lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, none of that, Giraffe,&rdquo; he whispered,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he might jump on us!&rdquo; expostulated the
tall scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Allan?&rdquo; asked the patrol
leader, who did not like the idea of such a happening
any more than Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will, if we keep back,&rdquo; replied
Allan, coolly; &ldquo;that is, if I know anything about
the nature of the beasts; and I ought to. He objects
to our being in his game preserves, that&rsquo;s all,
and is trying to serve notice on us the best he
knows how, that he&rsquo;s cleared the decks for action,
and means to fight, unless we turn around and
quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve of the thing!&rdquo; muttered Giraffe,
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about going around, and letting the old
thing alone?&rdquo; suggested Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;d find him on to that game,&rdquo; Allan
went on to say. &ldquo;Chances are he&rsquo;d just keep pace
with us; and when we started to advance again,
we&rsquo;d see his yellow eyes, and hear his warning
growl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! and do we have to take water from a
painter?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, giving the dangerous
animal the name by which it is generally known
among all backwoodsmen and forest rangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say let&rsquo;s knock him over. Every one draw
a bead on those yellow eyes, and Thad give the word
to fire. We&rsquo;ll pepper him so well he never can
know what hit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Step Hen who made this war-like proposal;
but Thad cautioned his comrades against any
such rash action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d be pretty sure to
kill the beast. He couldn&rsquo;t stand for such a volley
at short range. But you understand, such a fierce
racket would tell everybody inside of five miles that
we were around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen, quite crushed. &ldquo;I
forgot those thieves of timber men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do, then, Thad;&rdquo; pleaded
Giraffe, at his wits&rsquo; ends to grapple with the perplexing
problem.</p>
<p>As usual it was Thad who saw a way out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to scare him off,&rdquo; he said, in a
resolute tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we, when we dassn&rsquo;t shout even,
for fear of telling the fellers around that camp-fire
all about us?&rdquo; Step Hen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a way,&rdquo; Thad said, quietly, just
as though he might be running things over in that
clever mind of his, and trying to decide whether it
would pay to try the plan he had in view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us?&rdquo; urged Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen, and if any of you think it&rsquo;s too
risky, just say so, and we&rsquo;ll try something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Thad said this, the others imagined he was
about to propose an advance on the enemy from all
sides. Confused by having four enemies approaching
from as many quarters, perhaps the panther
might think discretion the better part of valor, and
turn tail and run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>So Giraffe and Step Hen drew in long breaths,
and shut their teeth together in a firm, determined
way; doubtless resolving to do their duty, as scouts
always should, no matter what the risk.</p>
<p>But they were very much surprised when Thad&rsquo;s
explanation turned out to be something of an entirely
different nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just by chance,&rdquo; he went on to say, while all of
them kept watching those glowing balls of yellow
fire so close by, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got with me one of those new
patent little flashlights Davy has been using to take
pictures with at night time. All you have to do is
to hold it out, and pull the thing off. If that suddenly
dazzled the eyes of the panther, I&rsquo;ve got a
good notion he&rsquo;d move along. How about it,
Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; chuckled the Maine
boy. &ldquo;All the cat tribe seem to be dreadfully afraid
of fire. Yes, that would sure fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Giraffe nor Step Hen gave utterance to a
single word, one way or the other. They were, as
the former would have expressed it, &ldquo;just tickled
to death&rdquo; by this bright suggestion on the part of
the scout leader. And doubtless neither scout ever
would believe, deep down in his admiring heart,
that Thad simply &ldquo;chanced&rdquo; to have the explosive
cartridge in his possession. Rather were they
positive that he must have foreseen this very difficulty,
and prepared for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only trouble is this,&rdquo; Thad continued, even
while he handed his gun over to Step Hen, and
seemed to be fumbling with both hands, as though
getting the little new-fangled flashlight cartridge in
readiness for action; &ldquo;do you think the sudden
illumination will be seen at the camp yonder; and
if so what do you expect Hank and Pierre will believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it will be seen, all right,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; put in Step Hen, as though he felt
it his duty to give his opinion with the rest, just
to show that he grasped the situation; &ldquo;because
those things make a fierce flare-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to use it, all the same, Thad,&rdquo;
remarked Allan. &ldquo;If the men notice it at all, the
chances are ten to one they&rsquo;ll think it was only some
little lightning. Since that storm anything goes, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little lightning it is, then,&rdquo; returned the scoutmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of us had better hold ourselves ready
to shoot, if the beast jumps this way instead of the
other,&rdquo; Allan suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we will,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time,&rdquo; whispered Step Hen, gently lowering
Thad&rsquo;s gun to the ground, so he could handle
his own better.</p>
<p>Now, Thad knew how both of them were apt to
be impulsive, and he thought it best to warn them
against precipitate action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, boys. The chances are, you won&rsquo;t have
to shoot. Use good judgment, and don&rsquo;t spoil
things. Keep your eyes on that spot. Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Thad!&rdquo; whispered Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; muttered Step Hen, partly holding his
breath with suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Here she goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had Thad spoken these words than there
was a dazzling flash. He had been wise enough to
hold the little cartridge pistol out at right angles, so
that the fierce white glare might not blind them, as
he hoped it would do in connection with the panther.</p>
<p>All of the boys were eagerly on the watch; and
knowing just where to look they instantly sighted
the panther. The abrupt and terrific burst of intense
light had produced an effect upon the startled
beast, just as Thad and Allan had so confidently
predicted.</p>
<p>The boys saw a long, lithe, gray body leap wildly
into the air. This was the beast that had just been
disputing their right to advance further into his
domain.</p>
<p>Evidently the cautious nature of the panther, together
with his well-known fear of fire, had combined
to give him a shock; for when he made that
spasmodic leap into the air, it was <i>away</i> from the
&ldquo;little lightning,&rdquo; and not toward it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>For a second or two only did that brilliant
illumination continue. Then darkness once more
swallowed up the surroundings; and doubtless it was
all the more dense to the eyes of the four boys because
of that recent dazzling flash.</p>
<p>They could hear a patter of feline feet among the
dead leaves; but the sounds were retreating. There
also came a low whimper. Allan told them later
that a panther always gives utterance to such a complaining
sound when he has been whipped in a fight,
and made to slink off; or else frightened in any
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said Allan, reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chances are, he won&rsquo;t dare to block our
path again in a hurry,&rdquo; Thad declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that old painter must a got a shock,
though,&rdquo; Giraffe went on. &ldquo;It was enough to scare
anything that walks on four legs, or even two.
Fact is, if I hadn&rsquo;t been looking for it, the giddy old
thing would a given me a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; admitted Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the way&rsquo;s clear, let&rsquo;s go on, boys,&rdquo;
remarked Thad, as he took his gun again from Step
Hen; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll hope all our troubles can be chased
away as easy as that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;CATCHING A TARTAR;&rdquo; AND A FAT ONE AT THAT.</span></h2>
<p>They had little trouble moving along now.</p>
<p>Somehow, it seemed as though the eyes of Step
Hen and Giraffe must be getting more accustomed
to the way obstacles could be avoided; or else the
woods had become a little more open. At any rate
they stumbled not at all now, which would seem to
be a lucky thing, because all the while they were
constantly drawing closer to the fire.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan knew they had need of caution.
Those two precious rogues of timber spies were
roaming this region with the intention of locating
patches of valuable trees near enough to a stream
to be felled, and floated down by the next Spring
freshet. They were on Government land, and their
rich but unscrupulous employers had been long
engaged in this form of robbery, by which the
reservations lose many millions of feet of fine
lumber every year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>And such men, knowing that their work is evil,
and that they are constantly breaking the law, suspect
every stranger of being a Government spy. No
wonder then they showed dislike at the mere mention
of the name of Toby Smathers, who was a
forest ranger, at times in the employ of the Washington
authorities, and always on the lookout for the
operations of timber thieves.</p>
<p>Thad could see some one moving about. This
happened when the other chanced to come between
himself and the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe that&rsquo;s our chum, Bumpus;&rdquo;
whispered Giraffe, eagerly, showing that he too had
been watching the figure.</p>
<p>They all used their eyes to advantage, as they
cautiously crept along. Presently they would have
gained a point so near the fire that it would be
necessary for them to change their mode of locomotion.
Instead of walking, even as they were doing
now, in a bent-over attitude, they must get down on
all fours, and creep, just as a panther would do
when approaching a feeding deer which he hoped
to pounce upon unawares.</p>
<p>It was one of the most exciting and thrilling moments
in the lives of Step Hen and Giraffe. Possibly
they could not conceive of anything more
typical of what must go hand in hand with scouting
business, than this creeping through the woods, and
constantly drawing closer and closer to a fire, about
which enemies would most likely be seated, all unaware
of their presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>They felt proud of the manner in which they were
accomplishing these things. It reflected great credit
upon their ability as scouts.</p>
<p>Nearer they crawled.</p>
<p>Why, Allan was actually down on his stomach
now, and he seemed to &ldquo;wiggle&rdquo; along just as they
had seen an angle worm do, or a snake. Yes, and
there was Thad copying the example of the expert
Maine boy.</p>
<p>It would seem to be up to Giraffe and Step Hen
to do likewise. They were quick to learn, once they
had a pattern to go by. And in another minute the
whole four of the scouts lay fully extended on the
ground, clawing their way along as best they might;
satisfied to advance, even though it be inches at a
time.</p>
<p>There was no longer any doubt in connection with
what might be going on just beyond. Even Giraffe
and Step Hen understood it now.</p>
<p>First of all they saw the lost tenderfoot; and it
did them great good just to feast their eyes upon the
portly figure of Bumpus, after all this searching for
him, day after day.</p>
<p>Then there were Hank and Pierre, too, just as
hulking, and ugly as ever, or even more so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>The two timber cruisers were evidently taking
their ease, stretched out at full length, smoking their
pipes. Something about the very air of the men
would have told an observer that they were enjoying
the novelty of being waited on. It was not
often that Hank and Pierre knew the luxury of
having a &ldquo;slave&rdquo; along, to humor their every little
whim; and they were apparently bent on making
the most out of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Evidently Bumpus was aware of the fact that he
might look upon himself as a servant, for the time
being. His dejected manner, as he sat there, gnawing
at some bones they had evidently allowed him to
have, after he had cooked supper, and waited on his
captors, seemed to tell this only too plainly.</p>
<p>Even as the four scouts lay there and looked,
they heard Hank call out gruffly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, younker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus pretended not to hear at first. Evidently
he dreaded to get too close to the men, for some
reason or other.</p>
<p>At that Hank burst out into a string of profanity
that was enough to make any respectable scout
shudder. And when he ordered Bumpus again to
come over to him, the fat boy evidently dared no
longer pretend deafness.</p>
<p>He approached the spot where the two men half
sat; and Thad could see from the wary manner in
which Bumpus did this that he expected rough treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git me a coal outen the fire, you fat fool; my
pipe&rsquo;s gone out again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Hank said this in the ugliest way possible.
Indeed, to judge from his manner, one might even
imagine it was the fault of poor Bumpus that his
pipe had ceased to burn, instead of his own laziness.</p>
<p>Bumpus forthwith stepped over to the near-by
fire. As he bent over, he looked cautiously behind
him once or twice, just as though the poor fellow
half expected to have one of his tormentors kick
him, and he did not want to have such a thing happen
so that he would plunge in among the burning
wood.</p>
<p>Securing a brand that was suitable for the purpose,
Bumpus advanced toward the two men. He
handed this to Hank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand thar!&rdquo; ordered the bully, as Bumpus was
edging away.</p>
<p>Applying the light to his pipe, Hank sent out
several puffs of smoke. Then, just as a smoker
might wish to extinguish his match before throwing
it away, he suddenly hurled the blazing torch after
the now retreating Bumpus. That worthy tried to
dodge, but was either too clumsy, or else Hank had
made allowances for this. At any rate, the brand
struck Bumpus squarely in the middle of his fat
back; and while it did not set his clothes on fire, at
least it forced a grunt from the scout.</p>
<p>Hank burst out into a harsh laugh, while Pierre
grinned. Then they went on talking as though regardless
of the presence of the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Thad had felt Giraffe quiver beside him when he
saw Bumpus abused and insulted in this fashion.</p>
<p>And only for Hank giving that laugh, one of the
men might have heard the gritting of Giraffe&rsquo;s
strong teeth, he was that worked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; hissed the scoutmaster, close to the
other&rsquo;s ear; and Giraffe subsided, though he was still
quivering all over from excitement and eagerness,&mdash;yes
and anger too. If he could only have had his
way right then and there, Giraffe undoubtedly
would have stepped out, and covering the two
rascals with his gun, threatened to shoot unless they
abjectly surrendered. And this time they would not
get off as easily as before. After the way they had
treated Bumpus, they deserved something more
severe.</p>
<p>But then Thad evidently was not quite ready to
act. Perhaps he wanted to see what else Hank and
his timber mate might do. Perhaps&mdash;but Giraffe
concluded that it was foolish trying to figure these
things out, when all he had to do in order to learn
the truth, was to possess his soul in patience and
wait.</p>
<p>Bumpus, true to his new scout training, even while
he was listening to the laughter of his tormentor,
and rubbing his back where the fire-brand had struck
him with such a thump; turned, and deliberately put
his foot upon the blaze, grinding it into the earth
until it was utterly extinguished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>It was really one of the most surprising examples
of newly-acquired discipline that Thad had
even seen. Nor would he soon forget it.</p>
<p>Bumpus was apparently watching the two men on
the sly. When he thought they were not looking,
the fat scout quickly bent over near a tree.</p>
<p>Thad had quite a thrill, for he saw that the two
guns owned by the men stood against this same tree.
Whatever could Bumpus be doing there? Again
and again did he turn his head to glance toward
Hank and Pierre, just as though he might be afraid
that one of them could see him. But Hank was telling
a story of some kind, evidently, for the rumble
of his heavy voice seemed continuous; while Pierre
lay on his back, both hands under his head, listening,
and smoking in a lazy fashion.</p>
<p>Now Bumpus had quitted the vicinity of the tree,
and hovered on the other side of the fire. He craned
his neck several times, just as though he wanted to
make sure of something.</p>
<p>Thad believed he knew what that <i>something</i> was.
He had discovered, close alongside the burly figure
of Hank, the ten-guaged, Marlin, double-barreled
gun belonging to Bumpus. Evidently the bully had
confiscated the weapon, and meant to keep it, as
something that might come in handy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Now, Bumpus was a poor loser. He had grown
to feel quite attached to that remarkable gun, during
the short period of his ownership. And doubtless
it had become more precious in his sight, after
the clever way in which it had worked of late, with
regard to that wildcat; and later on the lame grizzly
that had treed Bumpus.</p>
<p>Thad believed he had designs on that gun.</p>
<p>Just then Hank called out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git a kettle o&rsquo; water at the spring, younker, an&rsquo;
bring me a drink! Be quick, now, er I&rsquo;ll skin ye
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus picked up a kettle or saucepan, the only
one in sight, and of generous proportions. As Hank
roared at him to &ldquo;dip deep, and bring her full,
enough for a grown man,&rdquo; the fat scout hastened to
do so.</p>
<p>He approached, holding the kettle with both
hands. Hank half sat up, to receive it; which he
certainly did, full in the face. As spluttering he
started to get, first to his knees and then on his
feet, Bumpus, with an agility that was remarkable
in one of his stout build, snatched up his trusty
Marlin from the ground, and hastened to put some
little space between himself and the astonished timber
cruisers, already jumping toward the tree where
their guns stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use!&rdquo; shouted Bumpus, gleefully.
&ldquo;I took every cartridge out, and you bet I ain&rsquo;t
agoin&rsquo; to let you shove any more in. Sit down now,
or I&rsquo;ll open fire on you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;TENDERFOOT? WELL, HARDLY, AFTER THIS.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! bully for Bumpus!&rdquo; cried out Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em tight, old chum; we&rsquo;re here to see you
through, all right!&rdquo; shouted Step Hen.</p>
<p>Of course there was no use of trying to hide any
longer. Thad and Allan knew this, and that the
time had come for them to back Bumpus up, the
minute they saw him open hostilities in that astonishing
way.</p>
<p>All of them were on their feet, now, and hurrying
toward the fire. Hank and Pierre, being desperate
men, might have even thought it worth while to put
up some sort of resistance; but they had their talons
drawn when, upon investigating the condition of
their guns, they found that, sure enough, these were
empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>While the two men lay there at their ease, never
dreaming that the fat scout would have the nerve to
do anything but whimper, and shiver at the sound of
their harsh orders, Bumpus, laying out this wonderfully
clever little surprise, had amused himself by
working the mechanism of their guns, and extracting
the last cartridge. And it was the heavy rumble
of Hank&rsquo;s deep bass voice that had helped operations
along, by deadening the &ldquo;click&rdquo; of the
cautiously moved mechanical devises belonging to
the repeating rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop those guns, you two, and be quick about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad gave this order, because he knew that each
of the men would be apt to have a belt of extra
cartridges buckled about their waists, or slung over
their shoulder. And to an experienced hunter, it is
only a question of seconds, really, when he can shove
a single charge into the firing chamber of his empty
gun.</p>
<p>Of course Hank and Pierre hated most dreadfully
to obey this order; but there was no use talking;
the scouts had the upper hand, and if they knew
what was good for them they must do as they were
told.</p>
<p>In the first place there was Bumpus, excitedly
covering first one and then the other; and how were
they to make sure but that he might, even by
accident, have a cramp in his finger, while looking
along the double-barreled Marlin?</p>
<p>Then, as if that were not enough, four other guns
were bearing upon them, as the new arrivals advanced
in a line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too big odds, younkers, an&rsquo; we gives in;&rdquo;
but Hank used a good many more words than this
to express his disgust, only the rest were not at all
necessary.</p>
<p>He threw his gun down angrily on the ground;
Pierre was just as energetic, and both men fairly
glared at their boyish captors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step Hen, lay down your gun, and secure those
of the enemy,&rdquo; ordered Thad.</p>
<p>With a wide grin decorating his freckled face,
Step Hen proceeded to carry out the injunction of
the patrol leader. And one could easily see that the
boy took the keenest delight in thus having a hand
in disarming the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Thad, &ldquo;search Hank for a
knife, and take it away. Get his cartridge belt too;
and when you&rsquo;ve done that, give Pierre a whirl.
We&rsquo;ll just stand around, and be ready to plunk them
chock full of lead if they try to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men were utterly disheartened. They
seemed to realize that they were up against a tough
proposition. Everything was going wrong; and the
philosophy of your timber cruiser under such conditions
is to appear indifferent and reckless. Perhaps
they try to act very much on the same principle
as an Indian would, upon being put to the torture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>After fully disarming the men Thad saw to it
that both of them were tied up. Hank growled
fearfully, but the half-breed seemed to take the
whole affair somewhat in the light of a good joke.
This seemed all the more strange because nearly all
half-breeds, Thad had been told, were surly by
nature.</p>
<p>When this duty had been well performed, Thad
joined the others about the fire. Bumpus had had
his hand shaken again and again until his whole arm
began to feel the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bulliest feller in the whole bunch, barring
none!&rdquo; Step Hen had declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the way to being made a first-class scout,
that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Giraffe solemnly remarked, all his petty
jealousy gone, now that he again had hold of Bumpus&rsquo;
fat hand, and found himself looking into the
laughing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All along he&rsquo;s acquitted himself splendidly,&rdquo; said
Thad, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And none of us ever dreamed you had it in you,
Bumpus.&rdquo; Allan chimed in.</p>
<p>It was indeed a proud hour for Bumpus. Forgotten
were all his trials and anxieties. He would
easily have been willing to undertake the whole programme
again could he be sure of such a joyous
outcome&mdash;yes, even to being hectored, browbeaten,
insulted, and kicked about like a dog, by Hank and
Pierre.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Long they sat there, talking of the many things
that must of course be exceedingly interesting when
looked back upon as past performances. Bumpus
was asked strings of questions until finally he
threw up his hands, to announce that the well was
pumped dry.</p>
<p>Then they set about making ready to pass the remainder
of the night there. When another day
came they could decide what to do with Hank and
his companion, who were hardly the kind of men to
set free, with arms on their person, and hatred in
their hearts.</p>
<p>Of course Thad and Allan made up their minds
that they must, between them, stand guard until
morning came.</p>
<p>They dared not take any chances when dealing
with such desperate men as were the two trapped
timber cruisers. And when they saw that a vidette,
armed with a ready gun, was to keep the fire going
all the while, as well as watch them, doubtless the
men decided not to try and escape, but take things
as easy as possible.</p>
<p>There was no trouble.</p>
<p>Morning came, and found them up and doing;
for Thad was most anxious to return to the camp
near the foot of the rapids. After so many days he
felt sure the three boys left at the camp would be
dreadfully worried concerning the absent ones, and
especially Bumpus; because, of course they still considered
him as a poor, ignorant tenderfoot scout,
blundering along after a fashion, and hardly knowing
enough to come in out of the wet, when it rained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Ah! yes, there were a number of tremendous surprises
in store for Dave and Bob and Smithy, when
the full story of Bumpus&rsquo; achievements was told by
the glowing camp-fire; and mostly at that by those
who had followed his trail through the big timber,
reading the signs as they appeared, and observing
the remarkable progress the fat member of the
Silver Fox Patrol made, once he started thinking
for himself.</p>
<p>They had enough venison left for one good meal
all around, including the two timber cruisers. Thad
was worried about these men. He did not know
what to do with them, truth to tell.</p>
<p>If he sent them away with weapons and ammunition;
there was always a chance that sometime later
the fellows might again run across them, and give
trouble.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seemed rather cruel to turn
them loose in the wilderness, so far away from
civilization, and without arms, by means of which
they might obtain food, or defend themselves in case
of trouble.</p>
<p>Upon putting it up to Hank and Pierre themselves,
the men, quite downcast now, declared that
they were done &ldquo;cruising&rdquo; in that section, and
meant to get out of it just as fast as their legs could
carry them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us off this time, younker,&rdquo; Hank pleaded.
&ldquo;We got our lesson rubbed in good an&rsquo; hard, I
reckons. I&rsquo;m even willin&rsquo; to have Fatty here kick me
as many times as I did him; though I do say as how
he paid it all up when he played that fine trick on
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not surprising, therefore, that the gratified
Bumpus, in the goodness of his heart, asked
Thad to forgive the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Thad decided.
&ldquo;Leave their guns here, and take the men to the
camp with us. Then, if we decide to turn them
loose, they&rsquo;ll have to come half a day&rsquo;s journey back
to get the guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was decided to arrange matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">WELL-EARNED REST&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>Welcome indeed, was the sight of the two familiar
tents, with a cheery camp-fire blazing in front;
Mike and Molly, the two pack mules, browsing
near by, and the three boys who had been left in
charge caught in the act of cooking dinner.</p>
<p>It was just high noon on that day when Thad led
his little victorious squad out of the brush, and in
sight of the camp.</p>
<p>What an uproarious welcome awaited them! The
three boys, who had begun to grow heavy hearted
with suspense from long waiting and watching, vied
with each other in trying to see who could make the
most noise, and give the greatest assortment of
yells intended to take the place of a welcome.</p>
<p>Why, even the astonished mules looked up and
&ldquo;hee-hawed to beat the band,&rdquo; as Giraffe declared.
And when Bob White, Smithy and Davy Jones discovered
that sure enough their comrades were fetching
a pair of hulking prisoners along with them,
their delight surpassed all bounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting to be a habit with us, fellers,&rdquo; declared
Giraffe, proudly. &ldquo;Why, we just can&rsquo;t take
a little stroll any more, without bumping up against
a pair of bad men, who need attention. Don&rsquo;t
blame us; we just couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus, bless his dear old heart, was looking as
&ldquo;fine as a peach;&rdquo; nothing at all like the woebegone,
half-starved tenderfoot, whom those left in
the camp had expected to gaze upon, if indeed they
were lucky enough to ever see him in the flesh once
more.</p>
<p>With a beaming face he came along, his gun slung
over his back by the heavy cord that had come in so
handy when the grizzly chased him up a tree; and
as he walked Bumpus had both hands up to his
mouth, making sounds that would do credit to any
horn. And behold, the burden of the air, as the
shouting scouts recognized, was &ldquo;Lo, the Conquering
Hero Comes; Sound the Trumpets. Beat the
Drums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a great time as they had, shaking Bumpus
by the hand, pounding him on the back, and telling
him again and again how lucky he ought to consider
himself because he had such good and loyal chums,
ever ready to go out and succor the unfortunate, and
bring them home again safely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>And Bumpus never once lifted up his voice in
protestations or boastings, simply grinned through it
all, and kept one eye on Thad; who finally thinking
it was time the fellows were made aware of the true
state of affairs, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show what you&rsquo;ve got, Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine the great surprise, bordering on consternation,
of Bob and Davy and Smithy when the
fat tenderfoot fished in his pocket and held something
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foot of a bob-cat, as sure as I live!&rdquo;
ejaculated Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you kill it, Bumpus?&rdquo; asked Smithy, awed
by the very thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad says so, and <i>he</i> knows!&rdquo; was what Bumpus
remarked; and then with even a wider grin he
fished down in another pocket, this time holding up
some bulky articles that made the three camp
guardians fairly gasp for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grizzly bear claws! Great Jehosophat! you don&rsquo;t
mean to say that you found your bear, Bumpus, and
actually bagged him?&rdquo; cried Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I, Thad; you saw where I left him?&rdquo; replied
the Wonderful One.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure nailed him, good and hard, Bumpus,
even if it did take ten shots or more, fired into him
from a tree, to do the business. If ever anybody has
a right to say he killed a bear all by himself, fair
and square, Bumpus has. And here are three more
truthful witnesses who will testify the same way,&rdquo;
with which Thad waved his arm around to take in
Step Hen, Allan and Giraffe, all of whom put up a
right hand, and gravely nodded approval of his
words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And even that ain&rsquo;t all, fellers,&rdquo; quoth Giraffe,
&ldquo;what would you think now if I told you Bumpus
had turned the tables on these here two critters
who&rsquo;d captured him, and were makin&rsquo; him do all
sorts of slave stunts to please themselves? Yes-siree,
took all the shells out of their guns, and then
grabbed up his own to cover &rsquo;em. We <i>saw</i> him
do it all, so there ain&rsquo;t any mistake. If you doubt
me, ask Hank there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically the doubting ones turned toward the
big timber cruiser, who, playing his little game of
appearing to be very contrite and sorry, so as to be
let off easily, made a wry face, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest what Fatty did ter us; he give us the biggest
s&rsquo;prise of our lives, Pierre and me. That&rsquo;s the time
we fooled ourselves. He caught us, all right, and I
ain&rsquo;t got no kick acomin&rsquo;, &rsquo;less so be he wants to pay
me back that way; which I don&rsquo;t think&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
be the case, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s too fine a feller to be revengeful
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to shake hands with you again, suh,&rdquo;
said Bob White, the Southern boy, as he pushed up
to Bumpus. &ldquo;And right now let me take back
everything I&rsquo;ve ever said about your being a poor
tenderfoot. I reckon, suh, a heap of the rest of us
scouts&rsquo;ll have to sit at your feet, and take a few
lessons on <i>how to do it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A wild cat; a bear; and capturing a couple of&mdash;what
are they, Thad, pirates, or just plain hold-up
men? That&rsquo;s going some for even a first-class scout.
Just as Bob says, we take off our hats to you, Chum
Bumpus, and now, while dinner is cooking, just
gather around the fire and tell us the whole blooming
story,&rdquo; saying which Davy led the returned hero
of the occasion to the seat of honor.</p>
<p>The story was all told over again, both during the
eating of the meal, and afterwards. In fact it took
almost two hours to get most of the facts out.</p>
<p>Then they concluded to hold the prisoners until
the next morning, when they would be breaking
camp, to head into the valleys of the Rocky Mountains,
the tops of which reared themselves in great
granite masses against the western sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably have a good enough time the rest
of our vacation out here,&rdquo; said Giraffe, later on,
&ldquo;but you can be sure we&rsquo;ll never again see such a
string of exciting adventures as fell to our lot, and
that of Bumpus, when he was hunting through the
big timber for a bear; and the rest of us searching
for a lost tenderfoot scout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>But Giraffe was really mistaken when he ventured
to make this prophecy; for it was written that the
members of the Silver Fox Patrol were to meet with
still another series of mishaps and adventures before
they left for home. What these were, and how
cleverly Thad and his chums carried themselves
under trying conditions, will be found set down in
the pages of the next volume in this Series, now
ready under the title of &ldquo;The Boy Scouts in the
Rockies; or the Secret of the Hidden Silver Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very evening who should come along but
Toby Smathers himself. He had been ranging
through that section, really to find out what Hank
Dodge and Pierre Laporte were doing; and seeing
the camp had hastened to join the scouts feeling a
longing for human company.</p>
<p>Thad liked the forest ranger right from the start,
and was very much pleased when the other agreed
to go with them as guide during the balance of the
time they expected to spend in the Rockies&mdash;several
weeks at least.</p>
<p>Toby Smathers gave the two men to understand
that their every movement was being watched by
agents of the aroused Government. The Interior
Department was determined to put an end to timber
stealing on a large scale by men who had grown
enormously rich in the business.</p>
<p>Hank and Pierre professed to be alarmed; and
when they went away in the morning to get their
guns, which Thad had left ten miles off, they declared
they were going to reform, and either go into
the mines, or else emigrate to British Columbia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Toby Smathers, &ldquo;they ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
do it, mark me. Them critters are cut out for jail-birds,
and they&rsquo;ll either bring up thar, or else die
with their boots on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I hope is,&rdquo; said Thad, as he gave Mike,
the pack mule, a touch with the whip to start him
moving, &ldquo;that we never cross their trail again.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

<h3 class="pg">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
